# Alkot Studio (Interior Design)

 
Alkot Studio -  Barbara Albert  
Reference tour : https://conceptv.io/panotours/client/alkotstudio/conceptplan  
 
ConceptV is an innovative young company with a set of interesting solutions for interior 
designers. We were recommended to ConceptV by one of our clients, and after meeting with 
them and discussing the possibilities, they offered us a free proof of concept.  
 
Creating a design for a client takes a lot of back and forth, and we often run into problems 
where a client doesn’t fully comprehend what we’re proposing. In those situations, it can get 
difficult and time consuming to communicate our design and get useful responses.  
 
Our design process has mostly revolved around 2D  images we capture from Sketchup and 
reference images for the mood and style we’re envisioning. It works, but we can’t fully 
express and get feedback on what the intent is as we’re limited to what’s available and 
affordable.  
 
With ConceptV’s virtual tours  proposals should be much easier, especially for clients who 
aren’t very good at visualising. Their platform works with all the software we use, and the 
fact it’s readily available should make it much easier delivering proposals. We’re able to build 
in information panels inside the tour, so anything we need to explain or point out to the client 
is right there for them to see.  
 
We can also use tours of our projects to boost our marketing. Having this up on our website 
or sending one over to a potential clie nt gives us a strong point of difference and could easily 
generate new business.  
 
The proof of concept was a great exercise to test how we work together, and how we can 
improve the end result. Since we’ve received the tour, we’ve had a couple of feedback 
sessions to discuss   some redesign areas, learn about new tools and also to plan for more 
efficient future collaboration. 
 
From a pricing perspective, the prices we’ve been given are affordable and tailored to each 
project. By using ConceptV, we can reduce a lot of the non-design work we currently do in 
house.  
 
We’ll be using an updated version of this tour in our portfolio and on our website, to show the 
idea to other clients and attract more high-end business. We are working towards building 
the cost of t he virtual tours into our fees, as an optional project delivery option. We believe 
that future clients will be excited to see their projects come to life with an interactive model, 
and that many will pay the extra cost for it.  
 
ConceptV is bringing a much needed change to how design projects can be presented and 
shared between professionals and clients. We support their application for the Ignite Ideas 
Fund.  
 
Regards,  
Barbara Albert

To whom it may concern,  
 
Re: Concept V Reference.  
 
I met ConceptV  in February 2022, at the Independent Builders Network conference in 
Bendigo. They were showing their product, and we talked a bit about it. Since then, I’ve 
kept in touch with Tim and we’ve recently engaged them.   
 
There’s usually 3 main ways to capture b usiness as a builder: referrals, marketing and 
displays. I’ve seen an increased use of Matterport tours on other builder’s webpages 
since Covid, which is great to allow people to see the homes in full capacity. We’ve got 
hundreds of plans that we offer to our customers which we’re constantly adding to and 
it’s not feasible for us to get Matterport tours for our plans. We’d need to build a lot of 
displays, or make them once we finish a client home, but they’re almost always custom, 
not furnished and have a v ery long lead time.   
 
We offer hundreds of plans as well as bespoke plans to our clients. A lot of our clients 
struggle to understand what their home is going to look like from floor plans and colour 
swatches, which can lead to a lot of indecision and vari ation requests.   
 
I’ve seen a few of the big builders using virtual reality or big screens in their displays, 
but without the resources, the reach and the time they have it’s not something we can 
feasibly do. At the moment, we also don’t have a display hom e.  
 
Until I met Tim and Jackie from ConceptV, there wasn’t really anything available other 
than facade renders, colour swatches and floor plans to market our plans and guide our 
clients through design.

The product ConceptV  are bringing to market gives us new ways to compete against 
larger builders. It means we can have virtual display homes we can host anywhere, 
putting our sales people on equal footing with the larger builders. Further, their product 
is capable of showing multiple different options inside the virtual tour, meaning we can 
easily show customers the different options available to them for each design.  
 
We engaged ConceptV in July with a discount to create five virtual tours of new designs 
we’re bringing to mar ket. We’re looking at it as a trial to see how we can utilise the 
technology in the business. We’ll be using it initially in three areas: digital marketing 
campaigns, on the website and in person with our sales team.  
 
We can use their product in multiple d ifferent parts of the business, we gain a 
competitive advantage and it’s something we can feasibly afford. There are many more 
ways we can upgrade the tours for new purposes, and I’m looking forward to testing it 
in our business and seeing how it evolves.   
 
We are happy to recommend ConceptV for the Ignite Ideas fund, as they’re bringing a 
unique set of tools for the home building industry.

# Client Testimonials

Don’t take our word for it!
Architects & Interior Designers
“Having this kind of centralised system really helps when coordinating projects with engineers. ”
Steven Bishop  -  Director at SJ Bishop Architects“Utilising the platform from ConceptV was incredibly easy. It took our design ideas & brought our 3D renders to life to 
communicate with the clients. It was great for the clients to have a user friendly platform they had ownership of to show to 
their own friends & family. ”
Wayne Greenland  -  Director  -
“ConceptV has the potential to be a game-changing innovation in the way architects and building designers can further 
client engagement. Developing an intuitive and interactive tool, that puts the design quite literally in the palm of our clients’ 
hands, immediately elevates their level of involvement and input to make the project experience a truly collaborative 
endeavour. ”
Weian Lim  -  Director  -
“I was very impressed with the quality and level of detail produced in the ConceptV presentation, as were my clients. 
Looking forward to using it on my next project. ”
Demis Roussos  -  Director  -
“We’ve used other visualisation software before such as Enscape but ConceptV’s product is much easier to produce and 
far more effective.”
Evan Pickering  -  Director  -
“The innovation that ConceptV are bringing to the market enables communication on a whole new scale. With their 
technology, we would be able to curate economically viable design principles for suburban living through wide facing 
communication and feedback from the public. ”
Andrew Milward-Bason  -  Director  -
“Creating a design for a client takes a lot of back and forth, and we often run into problems where a client doesn’t fully 
comprehend what we’re proposing. ConceptV is bringing a much needed change to how design projects can be presented 
and shared between professionals and clients.”
Barbara Albert  -  Director  -“People are really able to understand and tangibly see what they’re getting. ”
Eloisa Greenham  -  Marketing Manager  -Home Builders
“ConceptV’s Virtual Tour allowed my clients to make a detailed list of changes in a single round. My design process has 
been streamlined from the reduced variation requests.”
Mat Dagg  -  New Home Consultant  -
“This tool is a much-needed solution for our sales processes. Since COVID-19 started, people want to see and do more 
activities online. This includes the freedom of planning their design without relying on a consultant, in their own time. Our 
selector can reach people anywhere, anytime. It’s very easy to use, and there’s nothing like it out there. ”
Keith Richardson  -  General Manager  -
“The product ConceptV is bringing to market gives us new ways to compete against larger builders. It means we can 
have virtual display homes we can host anywhere, putting our sales people on equal footing with the larger builders. 
Further, their product is capable of showing multiple different options inside the virtual tour, meaning we can easily show 
customers the options available to them for each design. ”
Luke Shephard  -  Director  -“During the construction phase, interpreting plans and renders can be quite challenging. With ConceptV, the intuitive 3D 
model of the Seachange project has brought to life what our client has envisioned for their home, making complex design 
decisions easier onsite, saving money and time. ”
Pete Richardson  -  Site Supervisor  - 
Property Developers & Sales Specialists
“One of the main things that impressed me was how multifunctional their products are. We can chop and change parts of 
the Virtual Tour and send it out, post it online, and integrate it with our brochures. We can generate images, link QR codes, 
and connect it to display screens. That gives us a variety of engaging material for clients in all stages.”
Grant Plummer  -  Director  -“The Virtual Tour is making us think about the space as a whole, before we build it, avoiding mistakes and profit loss. 
That’s ultimately the value of the 3D model if compared to traditional methods. ” 
Jason Blair  -  Property Director  -

End Clients
“It’s a fantastic tool and so easy to use. It has provided us with a unique perspective on how our new house will look. ”
Nick F.  -  New home buyer  -  QLD“If we had a Virtual Tour available in the early stages of our planning process, our queries could have been covered over the 
course of one or two meetings, saving us the several backs-and-forwards during the planning process. ”
Diana & Peter French  -  New home buyers  -  QLD
“We already had the BIMx model that we were using but ConceptV’s Virtual Tour was more detailed and realistic. 
Thoroughly enjoyed using the program. ”
Alan & Skye H.  -  Architect clients  -  QLD
“I have seen firsthand as an institutional investor how the construction and development process is cumbersome, unwieldy, and costly. By disintermediating the design and construction process with its innovative Virtual Tour offering, ConceptV 
has global potential to support a range of industry stakeholders, including architects, developers, builders, occupants, and investors, to improve the efficiency of the industry overall. ”
 Sean McBurnie  -  Investor and Advisor at ConceptV Investors & Advisors
“Having an interactive visualisation tool had a significant positive impact on our project, from making the right design 
decisions up front, to involving my friends and family, through to day-to-day management decisions and effective cost 
management. ConceptV’s platform is highly valuable, and I am actively recommending it to other building and design professionals. ”

# Competitor Meeting Notes

﻿Competitor Notes
SpecifierLab


Call with Ben Powell - 18/05/22


They offer 2 different types of services
* A publishing software, which is like a sandbox tool for users to manipulate files exported from Revit, Archicad, etc. This is essentially free for members of their network and they don’t really make money from it.
* Enterprise solutions - these are custom tools and solutions developed to meet the needs of their biggest clients. This is where the money comes from. 


Check their iDesign by CSR, these are visualisers with custom preset styles and filters developed for their clients. Examples: https://visualiser.gyprock.com.au/gyprock and  https://monier.csridesign.com.au/56da71dd-53e6-403d-bf27-ffdc4646bf57.


This software has been in the making for several years, with the oldest client being with the company for 8 years.


Their focus is to establish a network of builders, designers, suppliers, etc. They’ve signed some pretty big companies and get/distribute a lot of work based on referrals. Their goal is to form long-term relationships.


Their finishes and surfaces are from real Australian suppliers, like Coco Republic, Cemintel and Monier. 


They don’t do any modelling or client work in house - if a client needs someone to manipulate their software, they’ll refer them to someone on the network.


Ben mentioned a few times they don’t use any gaming engines, so it’s all render tech (which he described as more powerful and realistic).


When using the software, the user can assign finishes to all surfaces (it reads labels from the cad list and automatically selects different surfaces). The user can also select which surfaces will be “dynamic” - so the end user can change finishes. That might be the roof, the walls, cornice, etc.


The user can also control lighting, apply filters to the scene and furnish the rooms.


The software looks sophisticated, is easy to use and has a decent library. 


It takes about 8 minutes to “dress up” a house with basic surroundings (external only).


If the architect needs to change the file (such as change kitchen layout or move a wall), the software will save the details and update the work, so the user doesn’t need to start from scratch.


The user cannot change the background, but it’s possible to export the renders and orbits with transparent background for photoshop post-production.


There’s no limit to file size, he showed me an example of the Melbourne CBD uploaded to the software.


Files uploaded to the software are all cloud-based. Users can export their work as standard links or APIs. 


They also have an Analytics portal.


They don’t do interactive tours, but the user can export “orbits”, which are essentially 360 renders. To move from one room to another you go to the next image.


Ben admitted that this might not be the best option for one-off projects. Better for project homes, where there are 100’s of designs and combinations of finishes to be exported.


We’re not exactly competing on the same market, but they have a great advantage when it comes to larger developments and some of our long-term target markets. Similar solutions to what we envisioned for our Switch platform.


________________
Lucid Vue


Call with Brooke Smith - 23/05/22


Similar process to ours, in which they get the 3D files and go from there. They have the ability to do modelling in house, but the more 3D supplied, the cheaper the project.


To quote for a project, they receive and analyse the files to assess the amount of work, discuss requirements, then aim to send a quote back in 24h. There are no hidden costs.


Pricing ballpark was around 15k for a 2 bed apartment and up to 17k for a 3 bed apartment. That’s for a fully interactive tour, but without any custom functions, such as colour change. 


A full house costs a bit more, but usually stays under 20k.


Their clients with bigger developments will hardly model more than 2-3 units. Common areas (like an entry hall, entertaining room, bbq area) vary in price, usually from 5-10k each. She estimated the average pool area with some lounges and landscaping will cost around 5-7k.


They have 2 interior designers that can plan for the whole interior design, from scratch, or take their own direction with the project after a discussion on what we’re aiming for, target demographics, etc. They usually charge a “a few grand”  for the interior design service, but she reassured it’s not too expensive.


Delivery times range from 4-6 weeks for the average full project. Most projects are delivered within 4 weeks.


The Niseko project took 6 months, as the clients loved the tech and kept adding rooms to the scope. https://lucidvue.com/case-studies/niseko-virtual-tour/


Variations are not included, but usually cost between $350 - 550 each. They can also package those depending on the project requirements.


Virtual Tours are delivered as links/source code, so it can be texted or embedded on websites. There are no hosting fees, and tours can be hosted for an unlimited time.


Virtual Tours are compatible with any internet-connected device.


They also do rendering in-house, usually 1.5k-2k for an interior image, and around 3k for an external image. These get creeper if they do the Virtual Tour first.


They also have a tour specifically for architects with one-off projects. This is what they call a “white box” tour: rooms are not furnished and the finishes/lighting aren’t as sophisticated. It is essentially a lower resolution version, as architects and their clients are mostly interested in the overall spaces. 


They can quote more detailed areas separately, such as kitchen and bathrooms, depending on the client's interest.


This bare-bones tour usually costs around 3-5k.


Their whole tour interface was designed to be easy to navigate for the older population (around 60-80yo). Lifestyle communities are a big part of what they do.


They can work on custom tour features if required.


They’re targeting the same markets as our short and long term plans, but seem to have a solid client base and a fair number of enquiries. All the work is done in house.


They’ve been getting really good feedback and engagement from real estate agents. They usually text the client the tour link. No mention of QR codes.

Snaploader


Call with Eric Fink - 24/05/22


Most of their clients are property developers, but they also welcome private residential work.
Their client base is in Australia, US and UK.


They've been doubling their team every 6 months, enquiries are out of control, with a lot of repeat clients. Production capacity doesn’t seem to be a problem, but projects have to be booked in advance.


Not much of a cost difference if we give them 2D plans or 3D files. This is because they need to redo the whole model in their own system in order to simplify the plans. This process is similar to tracing.


Interestingly, they need to do a fly-through first to be able to generate a 360 tour. He called them Step 1 and Step 2, as they’d need to create the 360 scenes for the video, so adding the tour from there becomes quite cheap.


Delivery timeframes for the average development project is 6 weeks. Around 4 weeks if it’s just a single house.


They don’t factor design modifications in their process. Any redesign requests have to be quoted individually after the 3D model is delivered - it depends on how many hours it will take them to modify it.


They don’t have the ability to do any CGI in-house. What they do is create a gallery inside the tour using renders/collateral they get from the developer’s marketing team.


They also don’t take 360 drone shots for the surroundings. They have guidelines to provide to clients, or a guy that he can recommend in QLD.


Eric also said that a lot of people start small (like 1 floor or 1 apartment), end up loving the technology and come back for more. They seem to have a lot of return clients, including Allhomes (owned by Domain). 


They prioritise showcasing the whole development with every apartment floorplan over high-quality graphics. Completely different approach to Lucid Vue.


Their clients are getting very positive feedback from home buyers - they find it logical to follow, and get more clarity on how the buildings flow/look like.


The visuals are definitely not the greatest, but pricing is competitive and they make up for it with some of the functions and sales tools. They prepare nice proposals with images and descriptions instead of handing out quotes.


        



They have a few tools designed specifically for pre-sales, which includes their own version of a markup tool and analytics portal. They have developed an app for sales agents, which can be offered in conjunction with a tablet. They charge extra for installation and training.


They have the ability to update sale status (sold/available) live for their floorplan tours. That creates urgency and clients can actually see which units are still available.


Snaploader’s CEO is also behind Archistar. They capture developers early - at the stage of finding suitable sites - then offer them the sales package when the design is done.

To whom it may concern , 
 
RE: Recommendation Letter for ConceptV   
 
Tim called me in July this year after Michael Pikos from Pikos  Developments, gave him my number. Tim asked to meet with me 
and discuss my experience regarding off -the-plan sales for new developments.   
 
In my experience, clients find it challenging to fully understand spaces that haven’t been built yet. Trying to expl ain how the entry 
flows into the living space, or how pleasant the walk is from the swimming pool back to their home  can be incredibly challenging 
and subdue their value perception of the property.  
 
We’ve seen mixed results from trying other visualisat ion methods, such as providing more imagery, videos,  or virtual reality. Other 
than logistical integration challenges, these only painted a partial picture of the lifestyle we were trying to sell. Clients  were still 
unable to envision their potential life, and it’s difficult to guide them through the process when they’re not emotionally 
connected.  
 
Other interactive technologies are limited to when we see a client in person, at the office or display. Getting them there and  
keeping them engaged after they leave are completely different challenges. Once they go back home, they rely on memory to tal k 
it over with others and come to a purchase decision. As a result, there are often over 80 points of contact before a client bu ys an 
off-plan property.   
 
After seeing some examples and discussing possibilities with Tim, I think ConceptV can bring a unique so lution to this problem. 
Their platform is available everywhere, which opens the possibility to have effective consultations both inside and outside t he 
displays and reach potential buyers anywhere. It’s holistic and highly interactive, so we can tailor how  we show the development 
to different buyer profiles, and we’re able to dynamically respond to clients' questions and feedback during a meeting. All our 
existing sales and marketing material can be built into the tour, so we can find everything we need as we’re ‘walking’ through.   
 
One of the main things that impressed me was how multifunctional their products are. We can chop and change parts of the 
Virtual Tour and send it out, post it online, and integrate it with our brochures. We can generate images , link QR codes, and 
connect it to display screens. That gives us a variety of engaging material for clients in all stages, from prospecting and e nquiries 
to continuing sales motivation post -meeting and post -sale. This is the first product of its kind tha t I’ve come across, and I am 
looking forward to further exploring how it can benefit our sales process.  
 
I have arranged a trial with an active development we’ve been commissioned for in Taringa, Brisbane. I have not seen a produc t 
this versatile and dynam ic available in the industry, and I believe it will bring significant benefit to GAP Development Sales and 
companies like it.  
 
Kind Regards ,

To whom it may concern, 
Reference tour:  https://imaginekithomes.com.au/plans/eco-box-3/  
 
I wanted to give my website visitors a tool that they could use to test different design and 
finish options, and configure a kit home that suits their needs. We’ve been in touch with ConceptV since they started in 2019 and have given them feedback on their product as it 
evolved. 
 
 
Since Covid, we see lot more online purchases of our kits, and we want to capitalise on that 
momentum. We had a quoting system made for it, but customers still couldn’t see what the options they’d chosen actually looked like. I was talking to Tim about this at the start of 2022, 
and when he told me his platform could now generate exactly what we needed, we agreed to 
do a discounted initial trial. 
 
 They delivered it to us a few months later, fully configured to connect with our new quoting system and doing exactly what we wanted. 
 
 
The selector ConceptV developed for us shows an instant visual and pricing update on the 
different variables we offer. We operate in quite a few countries, and now customers can just go to our website, choose a plan, select their configuration and instantly see what it looks like and what it costs. We’re looking at this as a way to create a new revenue stream, completely automated sales from the website. 
 
 
This tool is a much-needed solution for our sales processes. Since COVID-19 started, 
people want to see and do more activities online. This includes the freedom of planning their design without relying on a consultant, in their own time. Our selector can reach people anywhere, anytime. It’s very easy to use, and there’s nothing like it out there, which gives us 
a unique advantage over our competition. 
 
ConcepV’s unique product has changed how much we can achieve with the business. 
Having a completely interactive viewer that’s linked up to our quoting system is a game changer. People from all over the world can go to our website, choose and configure one of our kits and buy it. We’ve already ordered another 8, and we’re aiming to update all our designs over time.

# Lindsay Birley (Advisor)

24th August 2022  
 
Reference tour:  https://conceptv.io/panotours/client/conceptv/seachange/  
 
To the assessors of the Ignite Ideas grant,  
My wife and I commenced  the journey of designing our new home with a leading Queensland architect on 
our Scarborough property at the start of  2020. The house is highly personalised  requiring over 12 months 
of design investment in time and energy, partnering with several  professionals. Eventuall y we reached a 
point where my wife and I felt we had captured the true essence of the home and design details, so we  
approached ConceptV back in early 2021 after introductions from a mutual friend.  
 
Tim was testing new internal processes and offered an attra ctive proof of concept proposal for our new 
home  in exchange for feedback and permission to use the resulting work for  marketing  purposes . The 
concept was great, and I was very excited to see it once it came together.   
 
Our project was reasonably  complex w ith a sloping block, over four levels with a design  requiring a high 
degree  of engineering.  The architect, Chris Clout Design,  provided comprehensive  sets of floor plans, 
elevations, joinery designs, finish ing schedules and a few rendered images.  These along with other details 
from general discussions and site visits were passed on to Tim and his team.  
 
A few weeks later Tim call ed and sent me a text ink to w hat he called a “work in progress”. It appeared to 
be 95% complete to me. The reali sm, attention to detail and ability scan around in every direction brought 
the home to life. The solution require d no training, and by its very nature, is exceptionally intuit ive.   
 
We had invest ed 12 months  in the homes ’ design  with a leading Australian architect. I went through the 
virtual tour again on my phone at home.  I spent 90 minutes  with it and discovered 21 items requiring further 
attention via Tim’s solution . There are aspects that would be extremely difficult to identify if it wasn’t for 
taking a realistic and detailed walk -through of the home with the ability to view both interiors and exteriors 
from almost any p erspective.  As a result,  we felt much more co nfident about the design with the virtual tour. 
I could easily share with my friends and family to get their opinions, text the link and easily communicate to 
anyone at any time . 
 
The house is currently under construction by GRAYA. I passed the virtual tour to Pete r Richardson, the 
foreman, who uses it every  day on site. Having the tour on site with access for all key trades allow s 
everyone to visualise the result , understand the larger picture and prevent mistakes  or misunderstandings 
potentiall y resulting in additional costs .  
 
ConceptV’s platform is highly valuable,  and I  am actively recommend ing it to other building and design 
professionals .  
 
Having an interactive visualisation tool had a significant positive impact on our project, from making the 
right d esign decisions up front, to involving my friends and family , through to day-to-day management  
decisions  and effective cost management.  I believe they have a unique product that has incredible potential 
to succeed in the design and building sectors.  
 
 
Your  sincerely ,

# Notes to self on strategy and perspective and ideas

2023 [Title] [GPT this section is thoughts and strategy about ConceptV and what I need to do - Tim Geldard]
Get as many of the big guys as possible, raise more many. You can show the resources that went into getting them, lead time and support growth. 

You’re going to increase our revenue with a very very good Business Development management. You’re going to hire 7 specific people to demolish cogs exponentially by building the Property Wizard. You’re going to increase your capacity by refining outsourcing ability and asset library. 

We’re going to build demand in the market by selling the Virtual Tours, and we’ve shown the COA and lead teams on acquisition. We’re going to the build the system behind the product where our customers can simply build VTs themselves, and convert to a SaaS. 

You have found the exact people who are needed to deliver this, and all of them are keen and ready to start this month. 

This is what investors need to see. 

Put Jackie with the sales person. Those two become a 2 person team. 

Write up on position of the company, market, state of things etc for sales person. Give them all the information, and set KPI’s. financially motivate them with milestones. Get them to work with Jackie to come up with a way to do it. 

Work out how much of their investment + your expense will be claimed back as R&D. Show how I can claim back money spent delivering projects. Thus shows smart and effective use of funds. 

In your use of funds slide, show the actual people that will be added to The Team with their funds. Under each person, have a milestone track, showing what they will bring to the business. Like revenue generation for sales, and cost reduction or supply variability or % automated or something. 

Get Michael to make a Splashscreen that gives the user the ability to find all the materials about us. Different tour products, different documents etc. 

Make 20-30 sec video explaining what a Virtual Tour is, and where it can be used. Hire a videographer for this, ask Nick Christy if he knows anyone. 

Get all programmers to adopt as much AI writing code as possible. Everyone needs to look at what we’re doing from an AI perspective. 

Bring Jackie to pitches. She could ntrols slides

“We’re entering the market by building the product FOR them. In the future, the Property Wizard will let the clients build it themselves”

Get Jackie to find pricing on MetaLuxe. Show how much cheaper our build cost is than theirs. 

Explain you have more info if asked. Thing that has changed is I’m prepared, and closed $x sales in last month. Explain what we made, the property wizard, the revenue model and future plan. We’re entering residential sales market, market conditions indicate greater need over next 12 months, and two competitors have entered the market with success. In competition, say we have more information, but are focusing on Lucid Vue and MetaLuxe. Show how and why ours is way better. 

Market movements indicate an increasing demand over the next 12 months, and we plan to use that scale our business. 

Market rates are being set by lucid vue and MetaLuxe. We’re we to charge what they our, our gross profit would be 94%. 

Our Cirtual Tours are cheaper,better, faster and have enormous potential to break more markets. 

We’ve established a cheap and effective go to market strategy over the last few months. Direct contact, complimentary tour, sale. COA is $X for a contract worth $x annually on average. 

Get Jordie and Jackie to get me data on COA and costs etc. get graphs and everything so investors can check it out. 

Build a wizard for contractors that walks them through a demo project and then guides them through the process of their task. 

If we’re creating a wizard for how to make exactly what we need, we open ourselves up to reverse engineering. We can manually encrypt it by getting to put the work together in a confusing way, and we have scripts that change a bunch of the controls files according to a code we’ve made. 

Get Jackie to find the people on the board for target VC companies, and see if I know someone that knows them. Also get Pearl to find those VCs. 

iPhones have the ability to mix LiDAR and photogrammetry. Use a drone and a phone to scan an area. Use AI to read the images, and identify what is what. Based on that, apply rules to generate clean geometry with texture UVs.

To convince Grant: who knows, they might not accept. Either way you win. You’ve seen my one pager. You know what we’re building, and you can already see what it can do now. This is going to be history, don’t you want to be part of something? When Damian invests, you two will both be working on it. Won’t that be cool? 

A potential alternate SaaS: offer your services through design and construct, and build exact replicas of everyone’s documentation. As the Property Wizard improves, you’ll be able to run a fully accurate virtual tour that users can identify the problems with. Build the Property Wizard to something that ArchViz people can pilot it. Then sell su script ions to the ArchViz people.

Use our future AI plans, that doesn’t exist, that no one else can fry it because we make it. VC get hard on. 

If you haven’t got big developers for the pitch, show the demand by using direct competition. 

I’m pitch, when outlining competition, focus on the rigid structure, they can’t adapt with the current volition market. High density luxury residential is big right now because of market movements 24 months. Over the last 12 months, x big builders have gone under. That has reduced capacity by y. As a result, the industry must move away from large developments, little over 6 stories over the coming 12 months. Our direct competitors are Australia based, and their key industry is high density - it’s the only industry where the high cost doesn’t matter too much. Their demand and revenue will dry up. That’s why we’ve been moving into the architectural space. That’s why we’re developing name there, and building passive revenue. Direct competitors are likely wanting to target smaller builds, but their high cost will likely make it difficult. Our cost base is already at 10% of theirs, and with planned development over the next 6 months that is set to drop below 5% - opening up a plethora of markets they cannot access. 

We’re entering the market now. Timing is incredibly important for this. 

When talking about competition, explain how important it is to be nimble - we’re in u chartered territory and the whole industry is constantly changing between extremes. Lucid and Metaluxe are not nimble, and their focus market is their only market. The recent closure of x biggest builders is going to dramatically minimise the amount of high density developments over the next 12 months. This has happened before with different competitors in different markets. Situ systems couldn’t move, cut half their staff and I poached one of their best software engineers. 

Find competitors that have folded over the last two years. 

Next likely big push is in master planned communities, architecture in 12 months. Land developments would have kicked hard after the shortage. Find data. 

You MUST bring more AI into your pitch. These new multi-modal AIs (GPT 4) open up an entirely new way for people to interact with property. Image recognition and language models, combined with our system, can enable extreme efficiency. The Markup Tool, powered by GPT 4 and connected with the Property Wizard, can allow the design coordination of a project to do a process that would take 6 months in a single day. AI that lets people interface with the Virtual Tours enables the Property Wizard to do SO MUCH MORE. 

Find an AI person now. 

Add in the AI wave at the moment to the timing part of pitch? 

For Grant, get him to out in 250k as convertible note with floor clause. Raising more later, will have a higher val. For Damian: we will focus on developing good relationships with suppliers and architects. In 4-6 months, three of us get dinner. He’s a smart guy you said. He will understand what we’re building, and he will invest. 

For Tamara, to get her really pushing: give conditional offer, something to do with performance? Explain options. Explain exactly what it is that you’re building, and what your plans for it are. Building a billion dollar company. 

With Grant money, make him your sales person. Maybe grant additional shares for extra sales in x period. Or, commissions. Get him to setup meetings with developers who aren’t his clients. With Tamara, get all the info from her from her last product library plan, design the system and user interface and get that started. Make first Lean In about educating around supplier specification and say you’re doing research and getting and end client wants (better tech). Offer a free Tour and design tour discounts for people that respond to the survey and agree to interview. Part of survey is a couple of shots of their chosen plan, and a bit of info about it. Then get suppliers on board and build first version of system. Make connection with that researcher. Second lean in like a month or so later, discussing the results of the survey, and the product library you’re making. Do more free tours for first users. 

With grants money, get the AI team going so we can automate creation of supplier materials. Make user portal to standardise supplier onboarding and automate. Do for railclone too. Get Shane working on most common problems with architects. Get lost from Liam on what takes most time, standardise Architect upload. Get mock-ups from Jackie to show system for suppliers. Build plug-in for design software that connects with product library. Maybe use the product library stuff as a way of forcing designers to configure their model on a particular way, a way that makes it faster for us to do a Tour. 

For for all brain trust to do an AI course. Get Louie help to choose which one. 

Trademark Digital Tours

Push Grant and Tamara. 

Add a BDM to pitch. Your theme is time. Opportunity, setup and dev opportunity. You are ready to take on high volume. You have almost no time to dedicate to sales, majority is through using your network, which while large, is still developing. You are limited by your time in BDM role. Opportunity in development market is still there, but with market conditions that’s likely to dry up within 12 months at most. You’ve got a huge capacity and you’re building it more. You have an incredible value proposition that literally no one else can give. The colsest competition is charging an enourmius amount for an inferior product. All those restricted from using their product by price, but who want to, now have the ability to do. 

Explain the bit above

Hire both software developer and data scientist. They both build PW and V at same
Time. 

Spend money on that AI team from Amazon to build V2.0 of Vi. Make sure to get it made so GPT 4 can built swapped in later. For code, pay to be in python with clear documentation. 

For pitch, include rebranding to Vi. 

With direct access to developers pioneering AI models, we’re finally able to integrate AI to our company wide system and change the game. Early prototypes are supporting the thesis of AI compatibility. In fact, a crude system + prototype pair will generate a summary, to do lists along side suggestions and instructions, and delegate resultant work just from this conversation. 

I know I’m not the best financial manager on the world but Lyndsey, the whole world is about to change and it’s going to be quick. We are in the optimal position to not just ride the wave, but be part of making it.  (Refined and punchy version of this would make a great intro, along with something like ‘we (important to include him in your opening statements and everything company relates by saying you and I at the start, and we from then on) are on the verge of making history. I have good reason to believe that we’re a unicorn. We have next generation technology, strong market presence, a never before seen, market tested product, first movers in a massive blue ocean (something to say a replicable product type for like hundreds of adjacent markets), something like ‘a fully standardised delivery process that will service the whole world in less than 5 years.’ Conservative ARR for FY24 are $X even in a down economy. I’m relation to the down economy, you are taking advantage of the fact the economy is down. Why? Because developers at at risk of massive losses, everyone needs presales for debt. Everyone wants our competitors product, but only a select few can afford it. We’re bringing an upgraded offering at a fraction of the cost and are making it really easy/non exclusive for the remaining seperate developers to access it. Besides, our whole package is profitable at the same price as competitors providing renders alone. 

For Tim - other question prompts to come up with 

During initial elevator summary, 

Barrel - oat cappuccino 

You’re and AI proptech company working with developers to get their projects to market on time. too to get developments get to market earlier. 

saving developers time by simplifying/streamlining the design and sale stages. 

I run an AI proptech company. I work with developers to reduce time and money through design and sale. 

Super Human

South African investor - say something about castle lager 

‘Programmer’ - Eric investment NZ

BDM must be in a good network. Get someone expensive who is big in the developer world. 

I’m a brilliant guy with a great thing. Im looking for someone with a good network who will help me clean up the company and scale. 

For Lindsay, you’ve started making significant connections in property development giant owners, Venture Capital, governing industry bodies, technology, architecture in preparation for a mass launch. I’ve got the technology, the team, and the traction to be a unicorn. I need even cashflow to cover pits in revenue, and time for these connections to crystallise. 

Now. For downside protection. We have $250k committed, R&D and $x in revenue. Upside %=

You need to be touring, making connections. Going to these events, networking. You’ve got opportunity to be presenting at these events, yet you’re not taking them. You need to be flying places, expanding your network.   Money is holding you back. 

For Lindsay, you could talk about the side revenue opportunities. Your Vi is already as efficient as 3 people. You studied ML and neural networks when you started this, and the whole system is setup to automate a huge amount of management. We’re advancing, packaging and selling modules of Vi and we develop. 

For Lindsay explain what happened that you need it and why it’s unlikely to happen again. One section on Historic Finance Strategy, Compressed Timeline, Opportunity Lead Time, Resource Limitations: lean bootstrap, lumpy model. Lead time on opportunity, cost increase from shortening timeline. Why the same problem won’t happen again: Revenue in Pipeline, R&D, Industry Investment. What happens if no VC - Action: Extend timeline, reduce scope. Cashflow: R&D, Industry Investor, Revenue. What happens if no Industry Investor - Action: same as above. Cashflow: Revenue. Even low conversion, still x amount runway. No revenue, loan and R&D gets me x months. 

For Lindsay, could outline key sensitivities, the responses to SWOT. Could make a risk matrix after the SWOT. 

Perhaps for Lindsay, but for pitches in general, when talking about AI and Vi, the very fact of its existence as a vanilla, limited version cuts out so many obstacles

# Reds Group (Property Developer)

 
 
26 August 2022  
 
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
Reds Group are a commercial development company delivering community oriented spaces across 
Queensland.  
A projects design is the combined effort of architects, engineers, interior designers, lighting 
designers, landscape designers and many other moving parts all with a common goal: design a space 
fit for it’s purpose. With so many stakeholders involved, we experience significant difficulties that 
largely boil down to efficiency, and timeliness, of design communication. Everyone has their own IP, 
their own software and no one owns the whole thing. As a result, there’s a high level of risk for 
errors when it’s all brought together.  
When those errors are caught, there’s significant back and forth between revisions and reviews. 
When they’re not, they show up during construction or post completion – leading to re-work, late 
stage alterations or an end result that isn’t effectively designed for purpose. In any case, those 
design errors wind up costing large amounts in both time and money. 
Another difficulty we face during design is communicating design intent to the designers.  
“I want buildings that belong and look like they’ve been there for a long time. Having the view on 
how we want the facades to look, in context, at the earliest stages will save a great amount of time 
in policing what the architects are doing later on. Because it’s hard to manage what the architect 
think is the right method for designing a shop.” Jason Blair – Property Director of Reds Group 
We engaged Tim from ConceptV in November 2021 for a trial on one of our active projects in 
Everton Park. Tim was introduced by a business associate who had trialled ConceptV’s services and 
recommended we have a meeting. After explaining the difficulties we have, Tim provided us with a 
proposal for how his platform could help address those problems. We accepted Tim’s proposal for a 
6 weeks trial on our P6 project, which was in the work up phase at the time.  
ConceptV were provided with the requested files, and Tim was nominated as one of our project 
leads for the project. Tim was to be involved in fortnightly design discussions with the other project 
leads, updating the tour with new information, suggesting and developing tools based on feedback 
from the team.  
 
 
 
 
 In the 6 weeks after ConceptV’s platform was delivered, the team discovered: 
 a disparity of revisions between the architect, kitchen designer and bar design 
 an element of the kitchen design impeding communication flow amongst kitchen staff by the 
head chef 
 a kitchen rack with incorrect dimensions that would not fit in the space 
Since the trial ended, we contracted ConceptV to continue evolving the platform with design 
progress, and they are designing additional functions specifically built for our projects and process.  
The tour has been highly beneficial as a communication tools, especially among the many non-
technical stakeholders. Explaining the project in financial, legal and client meetings is much easier, 
and is far more comprehensible in a holistic sense than technical plans alone.  
We’re looking at this as a potential solution to the difficulties outlined above. With the 
understanding that the platform will evolve to fit new uses, we intend on utilising the virtual tour 
during the remainder of design, during construction, as part of our marketing and as a tool visitors of 
the development can use to find helpful information while there. From what we’ve experienced so 
far, the unique platform ConceptV have developed will likely fulfill it’s objective and go on to deliver 
further value in additional stages of the development process.  
We’ve already engaged ConceptV for another development in Redcliffe ( Reds Group - Redcliffe ) after 
discussing the advantages of using their platform from the very start of a project, allowing us to 
develop the concept design with respect to the surrounding environment. They later provided us a 
proposal with custom made tools, which we accepted.  
“One of the biggest costs in the business is building things when surrounding elements haven’t been 
considered properly. Often people can’t afford to rebuild, so have to learn to live with the mistakes, 
or mask them. The Digital Tour is making us think about the space as a whole, before we build it, 
avoiding mistakes and profit loss. That’s ultimately the value of the 3D model if compared to 
traditional methods.” Jason Blair – Property Director of Reds Group 
There have been teething problems during the process which was not unexpected, but overall the 
Tour provided by ConceptV has had a positive impact on our process and has helped identify design 
issues that would have been incredibly difficult otherwise. To date, we have not seen anything else 
like it in the market. It is a unique product that has the potential to bring significant time and cost 
savings to our business.  
“’Success’ for this partnership means that we're able to use the model all the time as we’re planning 
the venue, building it visually before incurring the construction cost. It’s also a matter of managing 
the input level from everyone - and making the model work.” Jason Blair 
After using it for the last 10 months, we’re impressed with the potential and have begun 
implementing it on other projects. We have 7 other active project which we intend on bringing 
ConceptV on board for.  
“The practical use of this platform has some incredible efficiencies, especially considering we tend to 
use the same team for multiple projects. I want to reduce the scope of the designers and get their 
input later rather than earlier, as their method of work is very rigid and hard to make changes 
without going out of the tender. From the business perspective, we need more time and certainty to 
assess viability before committing to a certain design. “ Jason Blair  We believe that ConceptVs unique innovation has considerable application in the property industry, 
and we look forward to continuing to work with them.  
 
Yours sincerely

# Reflections on people, pitches, business strategy, perspectiove

[Heading] Reflections on people, pitches, business strategy, perspective by Tim Geldard referring to himself (up until May 2023):

2023
Get as many of the big guys as possible, raise more many. You can show the resources that went into getting them, lead time and support growth. 

You’re going to increase our revenue with a very very good Business Development management. You’re going to hire 7 specific people to demolish cogs exponentially by building the Property Wizard. You’re going to increase your capacity by refining outsourcing ability and asset library. 

We’re going to build demand in the market by selling the Virtual Tours, and we’ve shown the COA and lead teams on acquisition. We’re going to the build the system behind the product where our customers can simply build VTs themselves, and convert to a SaaS. 

You have found the exact people who are needed to deliver this, and all of them are keen and ready to start this month. 

This is what investors need to see. 

Put Jackie with the sales person. Those two become a 2 person team. 

Write up on position of the company, market, state of things etc for sales person. Give them all the information, and set KPI’s. financially motivate them with milestones. Get them to work with Jackie to come up with a way to do it. 

Work out how much of their investment + your expense will be claimed back as R&D. Show how I can claim back money spent delivering projects. Thus shows smart and effective use of funds. 

In your use of funds slide, show the actual people that will be added to The Team with their funds. Under each person, have a milestone track, showing what they will bring to the business. Like revenue generation for sales, and cost reduction or supply variability or % automated or something. 

Get Michael to make a Splashscreen that gives the user the ability to find all the materials about us. Different tour products, different documents etc. 

Make 20-30 sec video explaining what a Virtual Tour is, and where it can be used. Hire a videographer for this, ask Nick Christy if he knows anyone. 

Get all programmers to adopt as much AI writing code as possible. Everyone needs to look at what we’re doing from an AI perspective. 

Bring Jackie to pitches. She could ntrols slides

“We’re entering the market by building the product FOR them. In the future, the Property Wizard will let the clients build it themselves”

Get Jackie to find pricing on MetaLuxe. Show how much cheaper our build cost is than theirs. 

Explain you have more info if asked. Thing that has changed is I’m prepared, and closed $x sales in last month. Explain what we made, the property wizard, the revenue model and future plan. We’re entering residential sales market, market conditions indicate greater need over next 12 months, and two competitors have entered the market with success. In competition, say we have more information, but are focusing on Lucid Vue and MetaLuxe. Show how and why ours is way better. 

Market movements indicate an increasing demand over the next 12 months, and we plan to use that scale our business. 

Market rates are being set by lucid vue and MetaLuxe. We’re we to charge what they our, our gross profit would be 94%. 

Our Cirtual Tours are cheaper,better, faster and have enormous potential to break more markets. 

We’ve established a cheap and effective go to market strategy over the last few months. Direct contact, complimentary tour, sale. COA is $X for a contract worth $x annually on average. 

Get Jordie and Jackie to get me data on COA and costs etc. get graphs and everything so investors can check it out. 

Build a wizard for contractors that walks them through a demo project and then guides them through the process of their task. 

If we’re creating a wizard for how to make exactly what we need, we open ourselves up to reverse engineering. We can manually encrypt it by getting to put the work together in a confusing way, and we have scripts that change a bunch of the controls files according to a code we’ve made. 

Get Jackie to find the people on the board for target VC companies, and see if I know someone that knows them. Also get Pearl to find those VCs. 

iPhones have the ability to mix LiDAR and photogrammetry. Use a drone and a phone to scan an area. Use AI to read the images, and identify what is what. Based on that, apply rules to generate clean geometry with texture UVs.

To convince Grant: who knows, they might not accept. Either way you win. You’ve seen my one pager. You know what we’re building, and you can already see what it can do now. This is going to be history, don’t you want to be part of something? When Damian invests, you two will both be working on it. Won’t that be cool? 

A potential alternate SaaS: offer your services through design and construct, and build exact replicas of everyone’s documentation. As the Property Wizard improves, you’ll be able to run a fully accurate virtual tour that users can identify the problems with. Build the Property Wizard to something that ArchViz people can pilot it. Then sell su script ions to the ArchViz people.

Use our future AI plans, that doesn’t exist, that no one else can fry it because we make it. VC get hard on. 

If you haven’t got big developers for the pitch, show the demand by using direct competition. 

I’m pitch, when outlining competition, focus on the rigid structure, they can’t adapt with the current volition market. High density luxury residential is big right now because of market movements 24 months. Over the last 12 months, x big builders have gone under. That has reduced capacity by y. As a result, the industry must move away from large developments, little over 6 stories over the coming 12 months. Our direct competitors are Australia based, and their key industry is high density - it’s the only industry where the high cost doesn’t matter too much. Their demand and revenue will dry up. That’s why we’ve been moving into the architectural space. That’s why we’re developing name there, and building passive revenue. Direct competitors are likely wanting to target smaller builds, but their high cost will likely make it difficult. Our cost base is already at 10% of theirs, and with planned development over the next 6 months that is set to drop below 5% - opening up a plethora of markets they cannot access. 

We’re entering the market now. Timing is incredibly important for this. 

When talking about competition, explain how important it is to be nimble - we’re in u chartered territory and the whole industry is constantly changing between extremes. Lucid and Metaluxe are not nimble, and their focus market is their only market. The recent closure of x biggest builders is going to dramatically minimise the amount of high density developments over the next 12 months. This has happened before with different competitors in different markets. Situ systems couldn’t move, cut half their staff and I poached one of their best software engineers. 

Find competitors that have folded over the last two years. 

Next likely big push is in master planned communities, architecture in 12 months. Land developments would have kicked hard after the shortage. Find data. 

You MUST bring more AI into your pitch. These new multi-modal AIs (GPT 4) open up an entirely new way for people to interact with property. Image recognition and language models, combined with our system, can enable extreme efficiency. The Markup Tool, powered by GPT 4 and connected with the Property Wizard, can allow the design coordination of a project to do a process that would take 6 months in a single day. AI that lets people interface with the Virtual Tours enables the Property Wizard to do SO MUCH MORE. 

Find an AI person now. 

Add in the AI wave at the moment to the timing part of pitch? 

For Grant, get him to out in 250k as convertible note with floor clause. Raising more later, will have a higher val. For Damian: we will focus on developing good relationships with suppliers and architects. In 4-6 months, three of us get dinner. He’s a smart guy you said. He will understand what we’re building, and he will invest. 

For Tamara, to get her really pushing: give conditional offer, something to do with performance? Explain options. Explain exactly what it is that you’re building, and what your plans for it are. Building a billion dollar company. 

With Grant money, make him your sales person. Maybe grant additional shares for extra sales in x period. Or, commissions. Get him to setup meetings with developers who aren’t his clients. With Tamara, get all the info from her from her last product library plan, design the system and user interface and get that started. Make first Lean In about educating around supplier specification and say you’re doing research and getting and end client wants (better tech). Offer a free Tour and design tour discounts for people that respond to the survey and agree to interview. Part of survey is a couple of shots of their chosen plan, and a bit of info about it. Then get suppliers on board and build first version of system. Make connection with that researcher. Second lean in like a month or so later, discussing the results of the survey, and the product library you’re making. Do more free tours for first users. 

With grants money, get the AI team going so we can automate creation of supplier materials. Make user portal to standardise supplier onboarding and automate. Do for railclone too. Get Shane working on most common problems with architects. Get lost from Liam on what takes most time, standardise Architect upload. Get mock-ups from Jackie to show system for suppliers. Build plug-in for design software that connects with product library. Maybe use the product library stuff as a way of forcing designers to configure their model on a particular way, a way that makes it faster for us to do a Tour. 

For for all brain trust to do an AI course. Get Louie help to choose which one. 

Trademark Digital Tours

Push Grant and Tamara. 

Add a BDM to pitch. Your theme is time. Opportunity, setup and dev opportunity. You are ready to take on high volume. You have almost no time to dedicate to sales, majority is through using your network, which while large, is still developing. You are limited by your time in BDM role. Opportunity in development market is still there, but with market conditions that’s likely to dry up within 12 months at most. You’ve got a huge capacity and you’re building it more. You have an incredible value proposition that literally no one else can give. The colsest competition is charging an enourmius amount for an inferior product. All those restricted from using their product by price, but who want to, now have the ability to do. 

Explain the bit above

Hire both software developer and data scientist. They both build PW and V at same
Time. 

Spend money on that AI team from Amazon to build V2.0 of Vi. Make sure to get it made so GPT 4 can built swapped in later. For code, pay to be in python with clear documentation. 

For pitch, include rebranding to Vi. 

With direct access to developers pioneering AI models, we’re finally able to integrate AI to our company wide system and change the game. Early prototypes are supporting the thesis of AI compatibility. In fact, a crude system + prototype pair will generate a summary, to do lists along side suggestions and instructions, and delegate resultant work just from this conversation. 

I know I’m not the best financial manager on the world but Lyndsey, the whole world is about to change and it’s going to be quick. We are in the optimal position to not just ride the wave, but be part of making it.  (Refined and punchy version of this would make a great intro, along with something like ‘we (important to include him in your opening statements and everything company relates by saying you and I at the start, and we from then on) are on the verge of making history. I have good reason to believe that we’re a unicorn. We have next generation technology, strong market presence, a never before seen, market tested product, first movers in a massive blue ocean (something to say a replicable product type for like hundreds of adjacent markets), something like ‘a fully standardised delivery process that will service the whole world in less than 5 years.’ Conservative ARR for FY24 are $X even in a down economy. I’m relation to the down economy, you are taking advantage of the fact the economy is down. Why? Because developers at at risk of massive losses, everyone needs presales for debt. Everyone wants our competitors product, but only a select few can afford it. We’re bringing an upgraded offering at a fraction of the cost and are making it really easy/non exclusive for the remaining seperate developers to access it. Besides, our whole package is profitable at the same price as competitors providing renders alone. 

For Tim - other question prompts to come up with 

During initial elevator summary, 

Barrel - oat cappuccino 

You’re and AI proptech company working with developers to get their projects to market on time. too to get developments get to market earlier. 

saving developers time by simplifying/streamlining the design and sale stages. 

I run an AI proptech company. I work with developers to reduce time and money through design and sale.

South African investor - say something about castle lager 

‘Programmer’ - Eric investment NZ

BDM must be in a good network. Get someone expensive who is big in the developer world. 

I’m a brilliant guy with a great thing. Im looking for someone with a good network who will help me clean up the company and scale. 

For Lindsay, you’ve started making significant connections in property development giant owners, Venture Capital, governing industry bodies, technology, architecture in preparation for a mass launch. I’ve got the technology, the team, and the traction to be a unicorn. I need even cashflow to cover pits in revenue, and time for these connections to crystallise. 

Now. For downside protection. We have $250k committed, R&D and $x in revenue. Upside %=

You need to be touring, making connections. Going to these events, networking. You’ve got opportunity to be presenting at these events, yet you’re not taking them. You need to be flying places, expanding your network.   Money is holding you back. 

For Lindsay, you could talk about the side revenue opportunities. Your Vi is already as efficient as 3 people. You studied ML and neural networks when you started this, and the whole system is setup to automate a huge amount of management. We’re advancing, packaging and selling modules of Vi and we develop. 

For Lindsay explain what happened that you need it and why it’s unlikely to happen again. One section on Historic Finance Strategy, Compressed Timeline, Opportunity Lead Time, Resource Limitations: lean bootstrap, lumpy model. Lead time on opportunity, cost increase from shortening timeline. Why the same problem won’t happen again: Revenue in Pipeline, R&D, Industry Investment. What happens if no VC - Action: Extend timeline, reduce scope. Cashflow: R&D, Industry Investor, Revenue. What happens if no Industry Investor - Action: same as above. Cashflow: Revenue. Even low conversion, still x amount runway. No revenue, loan and R&D gets me x months. 

For Lindsay, could outline key sensitivities, the responses to SWOT. Could make a risk matrix after the SWOT. 

Perhaps for Lindsay, but for pitches in general, when talking about AI and Vi, the very fact of its existence as a vanilla, limited version cuts out so many obstacles

# Sean McBurnie (Investor)

Invest or Letter of Recomme ndation  28 August 2022  
To whom  it may concern,  
I am a private investor  with experience across  some of the world ’s largest investment funds, 
including  recently as  part of Aware Super ’s Real Estate investment team , where I engaged in 
direct equity investment  and portfolio ma nagement of a multibillion -dollar  property  portfolio.  
I had the p leasure of investing in Con ceptV in April of this year , having  first become familiar 
with the Company in 2018 when it was in an early conceptual stage . I have been e xtremely 
impressed  with the progress Tim has made since this time , and the opportunity to partner with 
him as an investor and advisor has me exc ited for the future traje ctory of the Company.  As an 
advisor , I have been able to bring my wealth of institu tional invest ment, due diligence , and real 
estate sector knowledge to partner with ConceptV and provide T im with strategic guidance as 
the Company pursues its ambitious next stage of growth . 
The market for Prop Tech is significant and growing, an d my investment was based on a 
fundamenta l belief th at Concept V offers an enduring value prop osition to stakeholders across 
the property value chain . I have seen firsthand  as an institutional  investor how the construction 
and development  process is cumbersome , unwieldy,  and costly.  By disintermediating the 
design and construction process with its innovative  Virtual Tour  offering, Concept V has global 
potenti al to support a range of industry stakehol ders, including architects , developers , 
builders, occupants,  and investor s, to improve the effi ciency of the industry overall . 
ConceptV ’s commercialisation has proven promising since the time of my investm ent and has 
been based on a well-considered strategic approach to the management of organisational 
growth  and change . Tim has built an extensive network across not only the property industry , 
but has drawn on appr opriate legal , financial and techn ical support in order to execute on his 
strategy . I have been consiste ntly impressed with Tim ’s purposive approach with respect to  
scaling ConceptV and his prudent deployment of capital to support the operational expansion 
and improvement of a v ariety of internal functions . Among these include:  
• Sales  – in growing ConceptV ’s client base over the cou rse of 20 22 with reputable  and 
high-quality  counterparties  in line with the go -to-market strategy and service  rollou t; 
• Operations and deliverance  – in ensuring  personnel growth ha s been tailored  to 
support recognised and critical business needs ; and  
• Product and t echnology  – through  a focus on iterating and improving the Virtual Tour  
offering to generate both time and cost efficiencies internally whilst responding to end 
user demand and improving the product experience . 
In impl ementing the go-to-market strategy, Tim has consistently demonstrated willingness to 
take onboard feedba ck and pivot t o the most prospective and pressing requirements facing 
the Co mpany. In doing so, he has been able to drive the best outcomes for his clients, staff 
and investors, which will serve him well as the commercialisation phase  continues to ramp u p. 
I am excit ed by the potential for the Ignite Ideas Fund to accelerate the growth of ConceptV ’s 
commercialis ation . Today , Concept V services a range of resident ial property players whilst 
partly t apping into the commercial property market . I have seen first hand , working in 
conjunction with Australia ’s largest property players, including Lendlease, how  the Virtual Tour  
offering can  provide effic iency advantages across not only the residential, bu t also the office, 
retail, and industrial sector s. The ease of accessibility and configu rability related to the visual 
outputs it produces is unmatched in the mar ket, especially from a cost st andpoint , and its 
applications have the potential to dis rupt not only key elements of property design , but also 
extend to property and construction management and serve as a key tool for enhancing the 
occupan t experience and investor due diligence . Invest or Letter of Recomme ndation  28 August 2022  
A grant from t he Ignite Ideas F und will see Concept V able to accelerate it s current 
commercialisation and growth strategies  in order to serve these critical adjacen t markets in a 
much shorter timeframe than would otherwise be possible.  In doing so , the grant will enhance 
ConceptV ’s ability to promote future f unding rounds, in turn support ing more r apid innovation 
and the creation of sustainable high-tech jobs. Today, ConceptV is not a nebulous  idea on a 
page but a very real service  on the cusp of trans forming the property industry  if provided with 
the appropriate runway to support its growth . 
As a Queensland native, it is always encouraging to see homegrow n products and services 
with broad national and international applicability . ConceptV is ideally positioned to support 
not only the State’s booming construction industry over t he next decade , but global innovation 
across the property value chain . I continue to be excited by ConceptV ’s potential  and T im’s 
impressive capabilit ies as a founder and CEO in exe cuting on his vision  for the b etterm ent of 
one of  Queensland ’s, Australia ’s and the wor ld’s most important industries.  
Yours  sincerely ,
