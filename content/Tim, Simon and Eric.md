Tim (ConceptV CEO), Eric (Director of Aura Ventures) and Simon (director of Base Capital) 12 May 2023 (GPT some names have been mis allocated here, separate Tim from the others):












Tim: This is the third time I've been to Sydney. The whole effort of going to an airport and getting on a plane, whether it's an hour flight or a three-hour flight, it's just as annoying.


Eric: In Australia, we don't see the point of doing interstate for a holiday.


Simon: This is the beauty of being miles from everywhere else in the world. What's the flight time to Bali?


Tim: Five to six hours.


Simon: I suppose you guys go to Bali.


Tim: We don't really have destinations like Mar DiUS. 


Simon: That's an international flight scene. I hate you guys. 


Eric: I never really thought of it that way. Like you guys would have the same issue.


Simon: Trying to go anywhere in Australia is a lot of effort. It's really cool here though.


Tim: I know that it's a six and a half hour flight to Bali because I was there and everything was fine until I fell off my moped and hurt my tailbone. Then I got really sick and I couldn't eat or drink anything for two days. The flight back was the worst.


Simon: So, I have mixed feelings about going places.


Tim: And you don't mind having a butler everywhere, like they show in the ads.


Eric: I never really understood purchasing a car until last year when I was traveling. In the US I felt poor, but in Bangkok and Bali, I felt wealthy.


Tim: At some point, both of you need to visit me in Cape Pine.


Simon: But how much do Ubers cost around there? I go to the North Shore for like $20.


Tim: That same trip's going to cost you $6. I caught a $40 Uber this morning for a 15-20 minute drive. I refuse to use Ubers if I'm in the middle of the city heading out.


Eric: It's faster to go directly to the cab rank.


Tim: It's more convenient to pay for an Uber to pick you up and take you home. Public transport is a hassle.


Eric: No chance. But a taxi is fine.


Tim: Seriously? Ubers are more expensive than taxis?


Eric: They price proof it. It's not ingrained in our habits.


Tim: Is that the case in Brisbane as well?


Simon: Could be.


Tim: My tactic is to start with low expectations.


Simon: Just to prove the idiocy point, what did you do? I heard you cut off your own thumb.


Tim: Yes, three years ago. I've been building stuff for ages. I grew up on a farm, so the mentality is to figure it out anyway. I was cutting up flyboard for a trade show and wasn't being safe. The table saw kicked back and my hand went right into the blade. It crushed the bone and ripped it out.


Simon: That sounds terrible.


Tim: They drilled in from the top bit of bone that was still there and then drilled it into my hand.


Eric: Wait, so that's the missing piece and they attached it?


Tim: Yes, the blade crushed that bit of bone and ripped it out. That's the little bit floating on top. There was like one millimeter of skin that was just flapping it off.


Simon: I texted my boss, telling him I couldn't make the trade show because I'd cut my thumb off. He thought I was joking and sent back a rude message.


Tim: I ended up calling a couple of friends. One came over and completed my work, while the other collected the trade show equipment.


Simon: The next day, my girlfriend took me from the hospital to the trade show. I was high on morphine and painkillers, still doing seminars and interviews.


Tim: I found three things difficult: picking up a coin, fidgeting with a small bead, and washing spoons while texting.


Simon: What's the dumbest way you've hurt yourself?


Eric: I once broke my foot trying to kick a soccer ball as high as I could. The ball was over-inflated and felt like a bowling ball.


Tim: It's unfortunate, but that's the job.


Eric: It's not just unfortunate, it's nonsensical. Take a football for example. It's designed for athletes to generate power and aim for a goal.


Simon: Yes, I agree. So you're saying one has to be smart and not just lucky?


Eric: Absolutely. But luck does play a role. Consider lottery for instance. You can't simply work your way to winning it, you need to buy a ticket.


Tim: That's right, buying a ticket is the first step. 


Simon: It's on the way to work.


Eric: Yes, and every time I buy a ticket, I feel like I'm improving my odds. Perhaps buying more increases the chances.


Simon: Let's start with one this week.


Eric: Sounds good. Remember when we saved last week? Maybe we can afford two this time.


Tim: That's a solid strategy. It's a game of probability, after all. The more you buy, the more chances to win. 


Simon: That's true.


Tim: Now, remember the time when the jackpot was a hundred million? We pooled in, and I was the one to buy the tickets. I had a good feeling about it, so much so that I missed my stop on the train. 


Simon: And you ended up losing your wallet.


Eric: Exactly. I was so stressed about losing the winning ticket that I paid $100 to get my wallet back.


Simon: So you were down $150.


Tim: Not to mention the potential hundred million.


Eric: But in the end, we won $1500. 


Simon: That was a brilliant move.


Tim: A great investment indeed.


Eric: It made me want to try my luck more often.


Simon: Let's do this.


Tim: Just remember, we're early-stage investors, not gamblers.


Eric: Of course, but I still enjoy trying my luck.


Simon: Once is enough, you've done well.


Eric: Yes, but it's interesting to note that despite missing all five numbers, we still won because of the power hit.


Simon: We could've been one of the 300 winners.


Eric: Yes, it was a rollercoaster of luck and unluck.


Simon: Yes, it was.


Tim: Now, let's talk about gambling.


Simon: There's so much advertisement around it.


Eric: In Australia, we even have the Melbourne Cup, where everyone gets excited. They even stop education for it.


Simon: When is the Melbourne Cup?


Eric: I think it's the first or second Tuesday of November.


Tim: That's correct. I remember in fourth grade, I had a good feeling about a particular horse. It was my teacher Ms. Bin who got me interested.


Simon: Tim, what's on your Christmas wish list?


Tim: I recall a time when someone was distributing small pieces of paper. One particular piece caught my attention.


Simon: And I won...


Tim: ...five Friday frogs. It was a big deal back then. 


Eric: That's a significant win in the playground economy. It's worth a lot, and it brought me many friends.


Tim: It gained me a lot of social standing.


Simon: It's like gambling.


Tim: Yes, it is.


Eric: I don't think it's as bad as...


Tim: ...the US. I believe you all are slightly smarter than us.


Simon: Thanks. Tim and I originally met at a pitch day. 


Tim: We connected mostly over digital matters, which I assume you and Mike also share.


Simon: At the last minute...


Tim: ...I received a message that the pitch was cancelled. I was disappointed but ended up spending 45 minutes getting advice from Simon.


Simon: Yes, I did help you out.


Tim: Hopefully, I'll give the same advice when you're in town.


Simon: Are you calling one of us an idiot?


Tim: I'm the one who broke my foot, so I'm the idiot. 


Simon: A broken foot is no laughing matter.


Eric: I broke my foot trying to kick something. Afterwards, I started drinking a lot of milk to recover.


Tim: You didn't break your foot kicking a soccer ball correctly, you did it wrong.


Eric: Actually, I broke my foot trying to defy gravity. I was trying to send the ball into space.


Tim: That's a story of a curious person trying to understand the world around them.


Eric: You're like Australia's Elon Musk, but with a broken foot.


Tim: Can you design a car?


Simon: No, but...


Eric: ...I can try to send a ball into space.


Simon: Are you training the next SpaceX engineer?


Tim: Not this time. 


Simon: We'll try again next week. How long are you in Sydney?


Tim: Until Saturday. I have some meetings, but we could meet for coffee.


Simon: That works. Let's meet after 2. Where are you based?


Tim: Two blocks from Monte Place, near Kings Cross. What email service do you use for work?


Simon: We use Office 365, but it's not great.


Tim: I use Zoho. I appreciate their attempt to disrupt the market.


Simon: Have you tried Superhuman?


Eric: It's hard to justify the $30 monthly fee, but it's useful. It has lots of shortcuts and helps me get to inbox zero.


Simon: If it saves you time, it's worth it.


Tim: Absolutely, even if it saves just an hour a day, it's worth the $30. What's a few hundred dollars in the grand scheme of things?


Eric: I agree. 


Simon: I'll give it a go. 


Tim: One day, I'll show you how it works.


Simon: Please do. 


Eric: We should go to a park and film this.


Tim: It's like sending a video to Elon Musk.


Simon: And getting Twitter verified.


Simon: Something amusing happened. This guy, 


Tim: It sometimes looks like a phallic symbol. I'm more concerned about your perception.


Simon: That's hilarious. But remember, all shapes and sizes.


Tim: I was with friends and one took a picture of the sunset. It was shortly after my thumb injury, so I was making jokes. The photo ended up looking like a phallic symbol. My cousin, a nurse, shared the story with her surgeon colleagues. It was an awkward moment.


Simon: What's in the background?


Eric: Who is that guy? 


Simon: That's the next model of the ex. It's so aerodynamic.


Tim: Have you seen Sabar's new gadget? 


Simon: No.


Tim: He rounded the top because of a movie.


Eric: He admitted that it doesn't affect aerodynamics, but he thought it was funny.


Tim: It's fun to be a meme character in real life.


Simon: It's enjoyable to throw Easter eggs if you're skilled at something. That's a legacy.


Tim: When I'm 70, I want to look back and enjoy how much I trolled everyone.


Simon: There's a story about my cousin, a photographer.


Tim: He wanted to do a Steve Jobs-type shot. The photo turned out to be humorous. I decided to use it for staff gifts, printing it on mugs.


Simon: You got targeted by an ad for that?


Tim: Yes, and it seemed like a good idea at the time. 


Simon: You printed a lot of those mugs.


Tim: Yes, I did. I forgot about them until my girlfriend found the delivery. I started leaving the mugs at friends' houses. It was rewarding when they found them later.


Simon: Why do you have this picture of me? Are you planning to print them?


Tim: I got new headshots done recently. I'm thinking of printing them as stickers and hiding them in seldom-used places. I also found heat-based mugs that show an image when hot. We've even made a 3D model to hide in the products we deliver.


Simon: Has anyone ever noticed?


Tim: No, but we are planning to run a campaign in two years where if you can spot all the hidden images, you'll win a prize.


Eric: So you're doing 3D renders?


Tim: Yes, we're focusing on architecture and privacy. I could place the 3D model in one of the neighboring properties. We've also recently discovered how to incorporate moving images into the online versions, so I'm thinking of including a hidden video too.


Simon: You're having a lot of fun with this.


Tim: Yes, it's important to enjoy the process. When I started, I knew it would be a long journey and now we're at a point where we can have fun with our work.


Eric: It's crucial to have fun where you can.


Tim: Definitely. I see it as a slingshot strategy. You grind until you reach a certain point, and then you can just have fun. We reached that point about three months ago.


Simon: So, how do you think your professional pitch is going?


Tim: I hope I come across as succinct and to the point.


Eric: You're doing a great job of tying in different concepts and simplifying language.


Tim: We're on the same page; you want to invest in Alex's venture.


Simon: And you're willing to risk your money on it.


Eric: You both are exactly the partners I've been seeking. It'll be a fun journey with potential challenges. 


Simon: I've already sacrificed a lot for this, so I'm in.


Tim: We need to start first thing tomorrow morning. 


Simon: After a long day of travel, I just arrived in Sydney. 


Tim: My partner is worried that I might move here soon. 


Simon: I'm open to the idea of moving. 


Eric: Australia has the best food. It's about the quality of the ingredients.


Simon: So you're talking about ingredient quality rather than the cuisine?


Eric: Exactly. It's the best on average. You'll find good food in Europe, but it lacks variety.


Simon: So you're saying the US has poor quality food?


Eric: Yes, even their steaks aren't good.


Tim: I've traveled a bit, and I can confirm, the food and coffee in the US aren't good.


Simon: That explains the prevalence of Starbucks there.


Tim: And that's why Starbucks couldn't establish itself in Australia.


Eric: Starbucks didn't make it here because it wasn't good enough.


Simon: They expanded quickly in the US, then opened a bunch of stores in Brisbane.


Tim: But they had to close most of them within two years.


Simon: There are only a few left now.


Tim: It was a failed business case.


Simon: But they do like their IPAs in the US.


Tim: Yes, especially in San Francisco.


Simon: A lot of IPAs there.


Eric: Speaking of drinks, when I sent the invite for this meet-up, I named it Castle Lago. I had to look up South African beers to find a name.


Tim: We manufacture about 20% of the world's beer.


Simon: That's astonishing.


Eric: At my local pub, I can get two beers for five dollars.


Simon: That's quite a deal.


Tim: But this city is expensive, especially property and dining.


Simon: You'd typically pay around 30 to 40 dollars for a meal here.


Eric: You could pay that for two people elsewhere.


Tim: But the higher salaries here offset the cost of living.


Simon: Have I told you about the power situation here?


Eric: My apartment's electricity will be out intermittently tomorrow: between midnight and 2:30 AM, 6 and 10:30 AM, and 4 and 6:30 PM.


Tim: Someone must have developed an app due to frustrations with similar issues.


Eric: This issue has been persistent for years.


Simon: It paints a confusing picture. On one hand, I want to go, but on the other, I'm not so sure.


Tim: My younger brother lives in the UK. Every time he visits Cape, he's reminded of its paradise-like qualities despite power issues.


Simon: You guys would have an incredible time there.


Tim: I don't know much about travel, based on my experience with Bali.


Simon: Just remember to bring your donuts.


Eric: There's no better place than Australia in the summer, be it Sydney or Brisbane.


Simon: I prefer cooler weather, but most people love Brisbane's summer.


Eric: Sydney's weather is perfect, Melbourne is hot enough on most days.


Tim: Some days it's so hot, you step out and immediately want to retreat to the air conditioning.


Simon: How did you guys meet?


Eric: It's easier to invest as an investor.


Tim: I could just text you to meet up, it's not weird.


Simon: It's common among venture teams.


Eric: We lost one to South Africa.


Tim: We gained one guy.


Simon: Excuse me for 10 minutes.


Eric: Brisbane and Sydney will eventually merge into one city, but it's a 100-year plan.


Simon: Infrastructure growth is slow.


Tim: In the late sixties, a traffic advisor from San Francisco suggested cutting off public transport and building highways.


Simon: A typical Californian approach.


Tim: It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now it's problematic. Brisbane built one freeway, cut off some train stations, and discontinued the tram. Now they're facing challenges.


Simon: At least we have electricity.


Eric: I can hardly imagine power outages.
Simon: They're disruptive.
Eric: Even a fire alarm test annoys me, but an outage is a whole other level.
Tim: It's more complicated than it needs to be.
Simon: It happens monthly.
Tim: Is that due to your building's age?
Eric: Over the top safety regulations are part of it, especially in Sydney. I prefer Melbourne's more laid-back approach.
Simon: Sydney tends to be overprotective.
Eric: If people can't learn from their mistakes, let natural selection take its course.
Tim: I've learned from my mistakes and improved.
Simon: And you've survived.
Tim: I think of this as an upgrade.
Simon: It's like we're trying to balance the American and British systems of law, finding a middle ground between total freedom and strict regulation.
Tim: Despite some odd rules, we've done well overall.
Simon: Except for the ban on soccer balls in the city.
Tim: Those rules are too strict.
Eric: Singapore's system is impressive.
Simon: Interesting.
Tim: These rules, though recent, have affected Singapore's tourism.
Simon: Most of their tourism is business-related anyway.
Eric: They've managed issues like legalized prostitution pragmatically to control potential harm.
Simon: They've established principle-based rules.
Eric: They enforce rules strictly, especially new ones. They rule by fear.
Simon: You were lucky when you violated the littering rule.
Eric: I didn't see a single police officer during my month-long stay there.
Tim: There might be strong community enforcement.
Simon: They seem to tolerate tourists' mistakes more.
Tim: It's a matter of balance.
Simon: You've got an outgoing personality, Eric.
Eric: I don't enjoy it.
Simon: It can be uncomfortable.
Tim: It's challenging to be thrust into social situations.




Eric: I respect those who can build their own brand and overcome imposter syndrome. However, I hesitate to publicly make bold statements if I feel I haven't earned the right to do so.


Tim: People tend to accept what's been promoted through an authority as gospel, a phenomenon visible during Trump's presidency.


Simon: It's problematic when someone asks you a question, expecting you to have all the answers.


Eric: When it comes to first-time site managers or other partners, I prefer to stay quiet unless I've worked with them long enough to understand their situation and offer valuable advice. Giving general observations and recommendations can be more harmful than beneficial.


Tim: As a founder, people are always seeking advice. They often preface their statements with disclaimers, highlighting that it's just their opinion. But the moment their words are put on a reported platform or online, everything gets misconstrued.


Simon: It creates a divide where some people are comfortable speaking on camera, while others, who perhaps should be speaking, opt to stay silent.


Tim: I'd argue for you to keep sharing your personal account, including your background and experiences, while also acknowledging that you're not always right. General feedback can be helpful, and if the audience knows your area of expertise, they can use your advice accordingly.


Simon: That makes sense.


Eric: We'll catch up tomorrow, right?


Tim: Yeah, I initially thought our meeting place was four hours away, but it's actually just 10 minutes from where I am. We could meet for a late lunch around 1:30?


Simon: Sounds good.


Tim: If you want to know more about what we do, you can scan this QR code.


Eric: Is this the email I should send?


Tim: Yes, this is for people I meet in person.


Simon: It's a neat concept.


Tim: I'm considering potential name rebrands, by the way. I've also been working on a crude business AI that can help with organization and documentation. Any suggestions are welcome.


Tim: I've set up a voice recording function to discuss business elements, tasks, and assignments. At the end of every day, it processes the information into categories for my team to see.


Simon: Always closely observe people like Boston Current. I'll text you in two years.


Tim: I once walked away with a giant blotch on my butt.


Simon: That's unique. I should stop talking, really.


Simon: He's a great guy, very ambitious, a bit like me. I think he's got a bit of an ego.


Tim: We got a New Zealand-based business, Univers flag, in the architectural space. Have you guys discussed it?


Simon: It's an interesting space. Architects are unique.


Tim: Given my track history, even if I know the right way, I'll still get lost. Should I go to Wynyard Station or Town Hall station, or should I catch an Uber?


Simon: I'm tempted by the latter, but I'd suggest catching the train. It's not a rush.


Tim: Okay, I'll catch the train then.


Simon: So, go straight down here to Tunnel Station, platform 5. That's a number you should remember.
