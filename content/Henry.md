Henry (advisor) and Tim (CEO ConceptV 15 May 2023):

Henry: You could create a one-page chart showing revenue by customer, with each customer numbered. This shows diverse revenue. Have a stacked column chart that shows revenue by use case. Mention that there are seven major clients at the moment across a diverse set of use cases. Explain current performance.

Tim: How should I approach different types of revenue, like repeat business or subscription-based?

Henry: For a two-month window, include a third column in the stacked column chart showing revenue types. Create a visual representation without numbers, just proportions. This will help explain the diverse set of customers and use cases.

Tim: I want to change the messaging to focus on the Property Wizard and submarkets.

Henry: Describe your grand ambition, then talk about the next 18 months. Discuss the current two-month pipeline and set a 12-month goal. Explain how diverse your revenue is by customer, use case, sub-industry, and revenue type. State your aspirations for the next 12 months and how you plan to achieve them. Mention that conversations have already started.

Tim: So start with the two-month pipeline, then the 12-month milestone with investments.

Henry: Yes, focus on the first 12 months and the huge property ecosystem. This is the first step on a long journey to tapping into the entire real estate market.

Tim: I'm wondering if I should mention our deep connection to leading-edge AI and incubator programs since AI is an attractive topic.

Henry: You could have two separate pages: one covering your team and their expertise, and another for tech partnerships like Amazon and leading-edge AI. You can present them together to show you have the right people and relationships to achieve your goals. As for mentioning AI, be genuine about the tools you're using rather than just using the term "AI" flippantly. Mention specific tools to demonstrate credibility.

Tim: We should mention how we're developing our system to be more variable cost-based, using PT four and models to convert our system to 80% variable cost base with affordable foreign labor.

Henry: Focus on one or two examples to show that you're serious about using AI and leading-edge tools. For instance, mention using GPT-4 to automate a task for offshore labor, reducing handling time. Also, discuss using transcription AI and multimodal GPT-4 for internal business communication.
