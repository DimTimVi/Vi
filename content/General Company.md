Note to self on investor conversations in general9 May 2023:


During the dinner conversation with the investor, guide your client to discuss the following points in a conversational manner:


1. Begin by casually discussing the company's recent performance and goals. Mention the diverse revenue sources and the seven major clients they've acquired. Share their aspirations for the next 12 months, potential partnerships, and plans to achieve these goals.


2. Seamlessly transition to the topic of revenue visualization, technology, and system features. Briefly explain the team's connection to AI and incubator programs, as well as partnerships with companies like Amazon. Highlight the modularity, flexibility, and GPT-4 incorporation in their Property Wizard tool.


3. Introduce the funding strategy by emphasizing the need for immediate funding to capitalize on opportunities, hire a business development manager, and prepare for the Series A round. Suggest a six-month short-term loan with a fixed interest rate and the option to convert to shares at today's valuation after six months.


4. Casually mention that they've prepared a one-pager, an 8-10 page deck, and a 2-3 page memo to effectively convey important points about the company. Reassure the investor that they are considering raising funds from existing investors at the current valuation as a convertible and are making progress towards the Series A round.


5. Enthusiastically discuss the current opportunities and the competitive advantage of their product. Briefly mention recent legal changes, connections to key people, potential annual recurring revenue, and the go-to-market strategy for developers.


6. Address the importance of timing, the development of the system, and its benefits for architecture tools. Share plans for staffing changes and revenue generation, highlighting the urgency of acting now.


7. Engage the investor by emphasizing the revolutionary technology and product strengths. Talk about the superior product with high profit margins, rising construction costs, and legal changes affecting the industry. Present the go-to-market strategy for developers and the ability to onboard clients quickly.


8. Finally, mention the additional purposes of funding, such as expanding networks, opening doors, gaining additional experience, and expediting the execution of plans. Emphasize how their investment would play a crucial role in the company's growth and success.


Throughout the conversation, maintain a friendly and engaging tone, focusing on building rapport with the investor while presenting a compelling case for the loan.
