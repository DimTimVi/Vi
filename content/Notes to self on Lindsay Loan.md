Notes to self on Lindsay (current investor who Tim is requisition money) on Bridging Finance (9th may 2023):


Post-quoting, assign Liam to introduce the Swapper system and prepare the nucleus for operation. Request Jordy's update on script completion. Instruct Jay to categorize furniture and furniture types relevant to architecture, design, and development industries, and compile briefs for different categories in order to outsource collection. Document the preparation process for furniture and material assets for the nuclear server. 


Direct Michael to draft a list of key automations for the skin and tour, and establish an upload setup for adjustments. Also, task Michael to include a cache-clearing refresh button at the top left of every tour. 


Commission Liam to explore deep search implementation for firm creation and draft a proposal. Instruct Jackie to compile the Angela quote. Assign Liam to resume the Omniverse development partner initiative and work on overlay custom code. 


Finally, create new, simplified slides for the architect templates, ensuring each slide is interactive to provide additional information. Arrange the information comprehensively in the short version.


In a conversation with Lindsay, begin by saying, "Lindsay, I'm onto something big here. I have well-thought-out plans." Make it clear that you're not just asking for money, but also want to share your vision because you believe it will make Lindsay proud. 


Be enthusiastic and share a brief background on the history, including the chart you described in an earlier entry. Begin the conversation on an excited note, "I really wanted to do this in person. When you're back, we've got to find time for lunch."


Proceed to explain your current status. "We've spent six years developing the Property Wizard, forming networks, connections, and conducting market research. Last June, we initiated a soft launch to test our system and gauge interest for our products, compressing our initial 18-month plan."


Highlight the positive feedback received from cold calls and industry network expansion, which prompted you to expedite the timeline by 12 months.


Over the past six months, you've been preparing for a capital raise - collecting case studies, testimonials, creating opportunities, growing clients, increasing revenue, making the right connections, finding industry partners and support.


You've been preparing for your capital raise, developing both your networks and skills, providing evidence of traction, refining your pitch deck, and setting up warm introductions. As a result, you've managed to raise $1.5 million through venture capital and three industry partners.


You're in late-stage conversations with two significant industry partners and are actively servicing two markets. Additionally, you have three significant potential industry investors in three other markets, one of which has already committed.


The conversation may also cover additional topics from earlier notes.


Note to self when discussing. Scratch that. When talking to Lindsay, you can preempt it by saying, look, Lindsay, where aren't into something big here. And that can come right after you've said, but before you consider. Let me explain the situation. 
I 
You can say, look, Lindsay, I'm onto something big here. 
I have well thought out, 
Recent 
Researched, scratch that. I have well thought out plans. 
Yeah, just that first bit. I'm onto something big here. 
Nothing, Mike. 
All right, now we right now ain't cash flow fucked. 
You can say something like, now I am asking you for money, but I am scratch that. 
But I want to telling more because I think you'll be proud in brackets. 
Add this as a footnote to this entry, G P T four. 
Lindsay will like this. It feels like a son, father thing. He likes that kind of advisory stuff. Close brackets being enthusiastic and happy about it. Give that brief background on the history, the chart that you showed earlier on. 
Scratch that the chart that you described in an earlier entry tree. Open brackets. Add this, scratch that. G P T four, add the following as a footnote in your reply search for references to previous entry to combine info, close brackets. 
Start out all excited, be smiley and goofy and start the whole conversation by saying, I really wanted to do this in person. So when we scratch that, so when you are back, we've gotta find time for lunch. 
Now to give you a brief catch up 
To where we are right now, show the chart. 
We spent six years developing the property wizard and forming networks and connections and market research. Market testing, market testing. 
Six months ago, scratch that. In June last year, we started our soft launch to test our system and to test appetite for one of our product, for one of our products, for some of our products rather than the planned 18 months. 
Oh, of further integration, uh, open brackets. You can summarize this bit. I guess scratch that close bracket plan for 18 months to do all this kind of stuff. 
But the response that you've got in both your cold call uptake and, I don't know, success in industry or network expansion or something like that. 
You brought your timeline forward 12 months, uh, right now. 
Scratch that in order to, I don't know, expedite our system them. 
Now we've done that and to do this, we needed to raise capital over six months. Over the last six months, I have been pre preparing for my capital raise, collecting case studies, collecting testimonials, creating opportunities, growing clients, creating revenue, making the right connections, finding industry partners, finding industry association and industry support, 
And grooming yourself for your capital raise both in networks and skills and evidence, traction, developing your traction and your investor network and your pitch and pitch deck and getting warm introductions and developing warm introductions and setting up warm introductions 
Through 
Which you will have raised one and a half million dollars. 
Three venture capital and three industry partners. 
We've been in late stage conversations with two significant industry partners, strategic industry partners in scratch that you have industry partnerships and they're actively servicing two markets at present. 
You have three significant potential industry investors in three other markets. 
One which has already committed, one of which has committed all of whom are well connected or whatever. 
Then maybe something about other stuff from earlier notes.
