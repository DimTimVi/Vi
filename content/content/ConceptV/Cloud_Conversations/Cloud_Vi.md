Notes to self on Lindsay’s Loan

Who: Tim Geldard
When: 9 May 2023
Why: ﻿Notes to self on Lindsay (current investor who Tim is requesting money) on Bridging Finance

Post-quoting:

Assign Liam to introduce the Swapper system and prepare the nucleus for operation and deep search implementation for firm creation and draft a proposal
Request Jordy's update on script completion. 
Instruct Jay to categorise furniture and furniture types relevant to architecture, design, and development industries, and compile briefs for different categories in order to outsource collection. Document the preparation process for furniture and material assets for the nuclear server. 
Direct Michael to draft a list of key automations for the skin and tour, and establish an upload setup for adjustments. Also, to include a cache-clearing refresh button at the top left of every tour. 
Instruct Jackie to compile the Angela quote.
Assign Liam to resume the Omniverse development partner initiative and work on overlay custom code

Finally, create new, simplified slides for the architect templates, ensuring each slide is interactive to provide additional information. Arrange the information comprehensively in the short version.

In a conversation with Lindsay, begin by saying, "Lindsay, I'm onto something big here. I have well-thought-out plans." Make it clear that you're not just asking for money, but also want to share your vision because you believe it will make Lindsay proud. 

Be enthusiastic and share a brief background on the history, including the chart you described in an earlier entry. Begin the conversation on an excited note, "I really wanted to do this in person. When you're back, we've got to find time for lunch."

Proceed to explain your current status. "We've spent six years developing the Property Wizard, forming networks, connections, and conducting market research. Last June, we initiated a soft launch to test our system and gauge interest for our products, compressing our initial 18-month plan."

Highlight the positive feedback received from cold calls and industry network expansion, which prompted you to expedite the timeline by 12 months.

Over the past six months, you've been preparing for a capital raise - collecting case studies, testimonials, creating opportunities, growing clients, increasing revenue, making the right connections, finding industry partners and support.

You've been preparing for your capital raise, developing both your networks and skills, providing evidence of traction, refining your pitch deck, and setting up warm introductions. As a result, you're aiming to raise $1.5 million through venture capital and three industry partners.

You're in late-stage conversations with two significant industry partners and are actively servicing two markets. These are GAP Development Sales and Mode. Additionally, you have three significant potential industry investors in three other markets, one of which has already committed.

The conversation may also cover additional topics from earlier notes.

Note to self when discussing. When talking to Lindsay, you can preempt it by saying, look, Lindsay, where aren't into something big here. And that can come right after you've said, but before you consider. Let me explain the situation. 

Tim: “All right, now we right now ain't cash flow fucked.”
You can say something like, “now I am asking you for money, but I want to tell more because I think you'll be proud.”
Add this as a footnote to this entry, GPT four. 
Lindsay will like this. It feels like a son, father thing. He likes that kind of advisory stuff, being enthusiastic and happy about it. Give that brief background on the history, the chart that you showed earlier on. 
The chart that you described in an earlier entry tree. Add the following as a footnote in your reply search for references to previous entry to combine info, close brackets. 
Start out all excited, be smiley and goofy and start the whole conversation by saying, “I really wanted to do this in person. So when we scratch that, so when you are back, we've gotta find time for lunch. “
Now to give you a brief catch up 
“To where we are right now, (show the chart)
We spent six years developing the property wizard and forming networks and connections and market research. Market testing, market testing. 
Six months ago, scratch that. In June last year, we started our soft launch to test our system and to test appetite for one of our product, for one of our products, for some of our products rather than the planned 18 months.”
“Of further integration, uh, open brackets. You can summarise this bit. I guess scratch that close bracket plan for 18 months to do all this kind of stuff. 
But the response that you've got in both your cold call uptake and success in industry or network expansion or something like that. 
You brought your timeline forward 12 months, In order to expedite our system.”
“Now we've done that and to do this, we needed to raise capital over six months. Over the last six months, I have been pre preparing for my capital raise, collecting case studies, collecting testimonials, creating opportunities, growing clients, creating revenue, making the right connections, finding industry partners, finding industry association and industry support, 
And grooming yourself for your capital raise both in networks and skills and evidence, traction, developing your traction and your investor network and your pitch and pitch deck and getting warm introductions and developing warm introductions and setting up warm introductions. Through which you will have raised one and a half million dollars.”
“Three venture capital and three industry partners. We've been in late stage conversations with two significant industry partners, you have industry partnerships and they're actively servicing two markets at present.”
You have three significant potential industry investors in three other markets. 
One which has already committed, one of which has committed all of whom are well connected or whatever. 
Then maybe something about other stuff from earlier notes.
Notes to self on strategy, perspective and ideas

Who: Tim Geldard
When: March to April 2023
Why: ﻿Reflections on people, pitches, business strategy, Tim Geldard referring to himself. Notes on strategy, perspective and ideas. Thoughts about ConceptV and what I need to do.
[ConceptV-Products] [ConceptV-Business] [Growth-Strategy]

Get as many of the big guys as possible, raise more money. You can show the resources that went into getting them, lead time and support growth. 

You’re going to increase our revenue with a very very good Business Development management. You’re going to hire 7 specific people to demolish cogs exponentially by building the Property Wizard. You’re going to increase your capacity by refining outsourcing ability and asset library. 

We’re going to build demand in the market by selling the Virtual Tours, and we’ve shown the COA and lead teams on acquisition. We’re going to build the system behind the product - which we’ve called the Property Wizard - where our customers can simply build VTs themselves, and convert to a SaaS. 

You have found the exact people who are needed to deliver this, and all of them are keen and ready to start this month. 

This is what investors need to see. 

Write up on the position of the company, market, state of things etc for the sales person. Give them all the information, and set KPI’s. financially motivate them with milestones. Get them to work with Jackie to come up with a way to do it. 

Work out how much of their investment + your expense will be claimed back as R&D. Show how I can claim back money spent delivering projects. Thus shows smart and effective use of funds. 

In your use of funds slide, show the actual people that will be added to The Team with their funds. Under each person, have a milestone track, showing what they will bring to the business. Like revenue generation for sales, and cost reduction or supply variability or % automated or something. 

Get Michael to make a portfolio page that gives the user the ability to find all the materials about us. Different tour products, different documents etc. 
This information is now available at https://conceptv.io/

Make a 30 sec video explaining what a Virtual Tour is, and where it can be used. 
This is now done. 

Get all programmers to adopt as much AI writing code as possible. Everyone needs to look at what we’re doing from an AI perspective. 

“We’re entering the market by building the product FOR them. In the future, the Property Wizard will let the clients build it themselves”

Get Jackie to find pricing on MetaLuxe. Show how much cheaper our build cost is than theirs. 

Explain that you have more info if asked. Thing that has changed is I’m prepared, and closed about $30,000 sales in the last month (April 2023). Explain what we made, the Property Wizard, the revenue model and future plan. We’re entering the residential sales market, market conditions indicate greater need over next 12 months, and two competitors have entered the market with success. In competition, say we have more information, but are focusing on Lucid Vue and MetaLuxe. Show how and why ours is way better. 

Market movements indicate an increasing demand over the next 12 months, and we plan to use that to scale our business. 

Market rates are being set by lucid vue and MetaLuxe. We're to charge what they our, our gross profit would be 94%. 

Our Virtual Tours are cheaper, better, faster and have enormous potential to break more markets. 

We’ve established a cheap and effective go to market strategy over the last few months. Direct contact, complimentary tour, sale. COA is $X for a contract worth $x annually on average. 

Get Jordie and Jackie to get me data on COA and costs etc. Get graphs and everything so investors can check it out. 

Build a wizard for contractors that walks them through a demo project and then guides them through the process of their task. 

If we’re creating a wizard for how to make exactly what we need, we open ourselves up to reverse engineering. We can manually encrypt it by putting the work together in a confusing way, and we have scripts that change a bunch of the control files according to a code we’ve made. 

Get Jackie to find the people on the board for target VC companies, and see if I know someone that knows them. Also get Pearl to find those VCs. 

iPhones have the ability to mix LiDAR and photogrammetry. Use a drone and a phone to scan an area. Use AI to read the images, and identify what is what. Based on that, apply rules to generate clean geometry with texture UVs. 

To convince Grant Plummer, from Gap Development Sales: who knows, they might not accept. Either way you win. You’ve seen my one pager. You know what we’re building, and you can already see what it can do now. This is going to be history, don’t you want to be part of something? When Damian invests, you two will both be working on it. Won’t that be cool? 

A potential alternate SaaS: offer your services through design and construct, and build exact replicas of everyone’s documentation. As the Property Wizard improves, you’ll be able to run a fully accurate virtual tour that users can identify the problems with. Build the Property Wizard to something that ArchViz people can pilot it. Then sell subscriptions to the ArchViz people. 

that don't exist, that no one else can fry it because we make it.

If you haven’t got big developers for the pitch, show the demand by using direct competition. 
Pitch Material

Who: Tim Geldard
When: 15 March 2023
Why: ﻿Pitch structure, market background, upcoming hires and tasks for sustainable growth.
[Virtual-Tour] [SaaS] [Property-Wizard] [Pitch-Material] [ConceptV-Products] [ConceptV-Business] [Growth-Strategy] [Market-Opportunity] [Networking-Event]

Tim: In the pitch, when outlining competition, focus on the rigid structure, they can’t adapt with the current volition market. High density luxury residential is big right now because of market movements 24 months. Over the last 12 months, at least 15 big builders have gone under, and more could collapse. That has reduced capacity by y. As a result, the industry must move away from large developments, little over 6 stories over the coming 12 months. Our direct competitors are Australia based, and their key industry is high density - it’s the only industry where the high cost doesn’t matter too much. Their demand and revenue will dry up. That’s why we’ve been moving into the architectural space. That’s why we’re developing our name there, and building passive revenue. Direct competitors are likely wanting to target smaller builds, but their high cost will likely make it difficult. Our cost base is already at 10% of theirs, and with planned development over the next 6 months that is set to drop below 5% - opening up a plethora of markets they cannot access. 

We’re entering the market now. Timing is incredibly important for this. 

When talking about competition, explain how important it is to be nimble - we’re in uncharted territory and the whole industry is constantly changing between extremes. Lucid and Metaluxe are not nimble, and their focus market is their only market. The recent closure of x biggest builders is going to dramatically minimise the amount of high density developments over the next 12 months. This has happened before with different competitors in different markets. Situ systems couldn’t move, cut half their staff and I poached one of their best software engineers. 

Find competitors that have folded over the last two years. 

Next likely big push is in master-planned communities, architecture in 12 months. Land developments would have kicked hard after the shortage. Find data. 

You MUST bring more AI into your pitch. These new multi-modal AIs (GPT 4) open up an entirely new way for people to interact with property. Image recognition and language models, combined with our system, can enable extreme efficiency. The Markup Tool, powered by GPT 4 and connected with the Property Wizard, can allow the design coordination of a project to do a process that would take 6 months in a single day. AI that lets people interface with the Virtual Tours enables the Property Wizard to do SO MUCH MORE. 

For Grant, get him to out in 250k as a convertible note with a floor clause. Raising more later, will have a higher valuation. For Damian: we will focus on developing good relationships with suppliers and architects. In 4-6 months, the three of us get dinner. He’s a smart guy, you said. He will understand what we’re building, and he will invest. 

For Tamara, to get her really pushing: give her a conditional job offer, something to do with performance? Explain options. Explain exactly what it is that you’re building, and what your plans for it are. Building a billion dollar company. 

With Grant’s money, make him your sales person. Maybe grant additional shares for extra sales in x period. Or, commissions. Get him to set up meetings with developers who aren’t his clients. 

With Tamara, get all the info from her from her last product library plan, design the system and user interface and get that started. Make first webinar with AIA about educating around supplier specification and say you’re doing research and getting info on what end clients want (better tech). Offer a free Virtual Tour and design tour discounts for people that respond to the survey and agree to interview. Part of the survey is a couple of shots of their chosen plan, and a bit of info about it. Then get suppliers on board and build the first version of the system. 

Make connections with the researcher from the “Investigating Building Product Selection and Information Transparency” article. 

Second webinar with AIA to happen like a month or so later, discussing the results of the survey, and the product library you’re making. Do more free tours for first users. 

With Grant’s money, get the AI team going so we can automate creation of supplier materials. Make a User Portal to standardise supplier onboarding and automate. Do for railclone too. Get Shane working on most common problems with architects. Get list from Liam on what takes most time, standardise Architect upload. Get mock-ups from Jackie to show the system for suppliers. Build a plug-in for design software that connects with the product library. Maybe use the product library stuff as a way of forcing designers to configure their model in a particular way, a way that makes it faster for us to do a Virtual Tour. 

For all brain trust to do an AI course. Get Louie help to choose which one. 

Trademark Digital Tours

Push Grant and Tamara. 

Add a BDM to pitch. Your theme is time. Opportunity, setup and dev opportunity. You are ready to take on high volume. You have almost no time to dedicate to sales, the majority is through using your network, which while large, is still developing. You are limited by your time in the BDM role. Opportunity in the property development market is still there, but with market conditions that’s likely to dry up within 12 months at most. You’ve got a huge capacity and you’re building it more. You have an incredible value proposition that literally no one else can give. The closest competition is charging an enormous amount for an inferior product. All those restricted from using their product by price, but who want to, now have the ability to do. 

Hire both software developers and data scientists. They both build the Property Wizard and Vi at the same time. 

Spend money on that AI team from Amazon to build V2.0 of Vi. Make sure to get it made so GPT 4 can be built and swapped in later. For code, pay to be in python with clear documentation. 

For the pitch, include rebranding to Vi. 

With direct access to developers pioneering AI models, we’re finally able to integrate AI to our company wide system and change the game. Early prototypes are supporting the thesis of AI compatibility. In fact, a crude system + prototype pair will generate a summary, to do lists alongside suggestions and instructions, and delegate resultant work just from this conversation. 

I know I’m not the best financial manager in the world but Lindsay, the whole world is about to change and it’s going to be quick. We are in the optimal position to not just ride the wave, but be part of making it.  (Refined and punchy version of this would make a great intro, along with something like ‘we (important to include him in your opening statements and everything company relates by saying you and I at the start, and we from then on) are on the verge of making history. I have good reason to believe that we’re a unicorn. We have next generation technology, strong market presence, a never before seen, market tested product, first movers in a massive blue ocean (something to say a replicable product type for like hundreds of adjacent markets), something like ‘a fully standardised delivery process that will service the whole world in less than 5 years.’ Conservative ARR for FY24 are $X even in a down economy. In relation to the down economy, you are taking advantage of the fact the economy is down. Why? Because developers are at risk of massive losses, everyone needs presales for debt. Everyone wants our competitor's product, but only a select few can afford it. We’re bringing an upgraded offering at a fraction of the cost and are making it really easy/non exclusive for the remaining separate developers to access it. Besides, our whole package is profitable at the same price as competitors providing renders alone. 
What is ConceptV

Who: Tim Geldard
When: 12 May 2023
Why: Other question prompts to come up during initial elevator pitch.
[Virtual-Tour] [Property-Wizard] [ConceptV-Products] [ConceptV-Business] [Growth-Strategy] [Pitch-Material]

Tim: ConceptV is an AI proptech company working with developers to get their projects to market on time.

We’re saving developers time by simplifying and streamlining the design and sale stages. 

I run an AI proptech company. I work with developers to reduce time and money through design and sales. 

Super Human

When meeting VC investors from South Africa say something about castle lager 

‘Programmer’ - Eric investment NZ

BDM must be in a good network. Get someone expensive who is big in the developer world. 

I’m a brilliant guy with a great thing. I'm looking for someone with a good network who will help me clean up the company and scale. 

For Lindsay, you’ve started making significant connections in property development giant owners, Venture Capital, governing industry bodies, technology, architecture in preparation for a mass launch. I’ve got the technology, the team, and the traction to be a unicorn. I need even cashflow to cover pits in revenue, and time for these connections to crystallise. 

Now. For downside protection. We have $250k committed, R&D and $X in revenue.

You need to be touring, making connections. Going to these events, networking. You’ve got an opportunity to be presenting at these events, yet you’re not taking them. You need to be flying places, expanding your network. Money is holding you back. 

For Lindsay, you could talk about the side revenue opportunities. Your Vi is already as efficient as 3 people. You studied ML and neural networks when you started this, and the whole system is set up to automate a huge amount of management. We’re advancing, packaging and selling modules of Vi and we develop. 

For Lindsay explain what happened that you need capital, and why it’s unlikely to happen again. One section on Historic Finance Strategy, Compressed Timeline, Opportunity Lead Time, Resource Limitations: lean bootstrap, lumpy model. Lead time on opportunity, cost increase from shortening timeline. Why the same problem won’t happen again: Revenue in Pipeline, R&D, Industry Investment. What happens if no VC - Action: Extend timeline, reduce scope. Cashflow: R&D, Industry Investor, Revenue. What happens if no Industry Investor - Action: same as above. Cashflow: Revenue. Even low conversion, still x amount runway. No revenue, loan and R&D gets me x months. 

For Lindsay, could outline key sensitivities, the responses to SWOT. Could make a risk matrix after the SWOT. 

Perhaps for Lindsay, but for pitches in general, when talking about AI and Vi, the very fact of its existence as a vanilla, limited version cuts out so many obstacles 
Team Meeting Summarised

Who: Tim Geldard and team
When: 9 May 2023
Why: ﻿Company investment and valuation history, and our objectives with new investment round
[Networking-Event] [ConceptV-Business] [Growth-Strategy]

Tim: We built the company using the lean startup methodology, bootstrapping it with a total of $200K over six years. Our financing strategy comprised of investment, the research and development tax incentive, and sales. 

In June, we entered the soft launch stage, expecting it to last 12-18 months. However, due to overwhelming interest, we expedited the timeline, necessitating the hiring of additional team members. 

In our three-month pipeline, we anticipate about $160K in revenue from various sources. Despite this, we're experiencing a short-term cash gap. 

We have about $100K confirmed through R&D and a $250K commitment, among other potential income sources. Despite the current challenge, we are very close to a significant breakthrough. 

The rest of my week is dedicated to networking meetings with VC people in Sydney and a developer summit. I need your help in organising all the materials I require. 

We'll delay the AIA webinar by two weeks. On the VC front, the company's committed value has grown to $4 million from $2.75 million in February. This increase implies that potential investors are willing to invest $250K based on the $4 million valuation. In two months, when we approach VCs, I aim for a $6 million valuation. The progress we've made in three months is incredible. Our development side has made significant strides, particularly in rendering and pipeline system development.

I've set up a virtual assistant to automatically convert our meeting into a report and action items, which should enhance our communication. 
Tim and Lindsay Pitch

Who: Tim Geldard and Tom Coe
When: 14 May 2019
Why: ﻿Discussing the structure for Lindsay’s pitch with Tom Coe, who is part of ConceptV’s advisory board.
[Pitch-Material] [ConceptV-Business] [Growth-Strategy] [Market-Opportunity]
Tim: I wanted to start off with friendly stuff, chit chat, just that and whatever. And then I want to go with something that is really exciting. I'm probably gonna make a point of the fact that I'm at work at the moment because we've just had a massive breakthrough with some really cool shit to get him excited.
And then, um, also go into what I've been doing for the last two weeks and like now the last three months has been absolutely wild. The amount of stuff that we've been doing. And then go into, now I've got some stuff to show you. Um, I will give you a, but I'll give you a heads up. I will be like, what? We're seeking bridging financing and that'll be, how should I go about that basically?
But cuz like, I don't want it to just come up halfway through about me being like, Hey, I have some Mike. Because that'll really stay in. Anything else? 

Tom: I think, I wanna say, I think, I think touch on the friendly stuff, like friendly introductions, but not too long. Cause like Lucy's bullshit, right? He wants to get along with it and he would want to know what's been happening with your company.
Like what? Tell him the good news first. Yeah. Tell him like, you're progressing, you're growing. Have lots of these opportunities in the pipeline. Um, tell him, show him that you like, see the risk. Associated with the current market as well and say how, how, tell the story of how you are having positive uptake because it is a cost saving tool.

Yeah, because you need to acknowledge the risks, right? 
Tim: And then sort of outline with being tenure manager or whatever. 

Tom: Yeah. We'll talk, you can talk about, I'll weave the AI thing into it as we may have a significant improvement in our efficiency and our costs.
That might mean that we don't need to bring on as many people if we can work through this thing, but that's gonna be a little while In the medium term, we're still gonna need to bring on some more people to keep up with our current growth. Yeah. That's the point where we stagnate or not stagnate. Yeah. Tell the good news story.
Tell him that you see the risks of the road ahead and tell him that you have mitigation strategies for them. Okay, so, and then, and maybe, maybe I don't need to go through and then explain to him why you need finance right now. You know that. 

Tim: Okay. All right. So I can give the overarching thing, talking about all the different really cool things. Positive first. 

Tom: positive stuff. And challenges. The challenges, yeah. Acknowledgement of that. 

Tim: Difficulty with the industry and everything like that. Um, and then have a going about and mitigation strategy and. And then go into, um, greater threats at the moment. Um, then around like now, cause we push this stuff up and then the economy, like, you know, our cashflow is lumpy as stock.

Tom: Um, we've got a shortfall. Yeah. So that's why you need a scale. So then you don't have as lumpy cash flow if you have more significant month penetration. 

Tim: I think the better way to go about this is from the agreement that time. It's a necessary thing. I don't need to convince him that we should go for the raise. That's an obvious thing. I need to convince him that it's a safe loan to give me that it is four, six months and what that time will give me like that's, that will be of extreme value to the company. It's two months from now after I've gone through more things with this current opportunity. Then I'll very likely be at a stage where any of these different things have come off where we've got this revenue.

Tom: Yeah. And also you may have a significant improvement in your cost per unit manufactured, if you can do this like turnaround time thing with like GPT four that alters those files directly. 

Tim:  Yeah, I probably won't talk too much about that unless us, I'll probably be like now. I'm not gonna go into it too much, but you can see on my work at the moment, um, over the last two weeks, we have potentially had a breakthrough that could completely revolutionise, um, the way this company can scale and what it can do.

Tom: Yeah. But I think, I think it's the key points to that, you know, good news. Acknowledging the risks in the road ahead, explaining why you need that financing now

Tim: then asking him for it, and then going into, um, now I prepared a short presentation to give you a bit more context around the label end at the moment.
Yep. Um, in order to help make your, your decision or something. So how did actually go about the ask? So it'd be like, right. These, these are the sort of reasons why we're in this cash flow thing. And I, I wanna make that easy to understand because that's a very reasonable thing to have happened given all of the contexts.
Yeah. Like this is 

Tom: extremely like Yeah. I think that's why it's so important that he sees you as good risk manager. Yeah. And that's why you go say, I acknowledge the risk in the road and the challenges ahead. This is why we need to position ourselves for that by scaling is if we are more diversified, our cash flows less lovely and we ride with the overall market and we can do that efficiently. Yeah, cut the narrative that I would be most inclined to buy into. Very true. 

Tim: one. Especially 

Tom: because, Now that you've mentioned that one of his immediate thoughts as an investor 

Tim: will be, well, what's gonna stop you 

Tom: needing another 50 grand and two? Exactly. Yeah. He doesn't wanna get deeper into our hole.
He wants to wait until the storm has happened and then go see what's left. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's the job. We've given an investor. Very true. I head off, mate, coming in. It's been very, very engaging, but I know you'll, I know, I know you'll crush it. Thanks, 

Tom: properly. Yep. I think you'll, you'll find a way, you know, like even if it leads you to a pathway where you have to lose staff for a period of time. Lose staff. Yeah. If you had to like Well, 
Tim: I've told everyone about the position that we're in. Yeah. That was a shit conversation.
Yeah. I think  That was before you and I thought when I was not in a great place. 

Tom: Yeah, it's tough. It's tough, man. Yeah, but you, you've just gotta, I've never had to do that before. That's the main point. You've gotta realise that you are here to keep this company running, number one, and keep everyone else happy and engaged in the work.
Number two. But like if the company goes under, they don't have a job anyway. Yeah, true. Yeah. So I don't feel bad about it. You're just doing, yeah. I. I don't like, I, I 

Tim: spent, I did quite a lot of reflection, um, since all of that cause I was in a bad place. Um, but I've been working on good strategies and since been working, actually, I've got myself back into, you know, a more objective mindset, recognizing all of the really awesome things and that it's. Really not a mark on my ability that we're like right here. 

Tom: It's, you're in the valley of death. That's okay. Yeah, it's okay. It's just part of the business cycle, mate. Like you're in the hardest part. 

Tim: Um, yeah. For almost the funnest part. Fucking hell. I like, I'm so excited.

[Pitch-Material] [ConceptV-Products] [ConceptV-Business]
Tim: Not to mention the potential hundred million.

Simon: That was a brilliant move.

Tim: A great investment indeed.

Eric: It made me want to try my luck more often.

Simon: Let's do this.

Tim: Just remember, we're early-stage investors.

Eric: Of course, but I still enjoy trying my luck.

Simon: Thanks. Tim and I originally met at a pitch day. 

Tim: We connected mostly over digital matters, which I assume you and Mike also share.

Eric: So you're doing 3D renders?

Tim: Yes, we're focusing on architecture and privacy. I could place the 3D model in one of the neighbouring properties. We've also recently discovered how to incorporate moving images into the online versions, so I'm thinking of including a hidden video too.

Simon: You're having a lot of fun with this.

Tim: Yes, it's important to enjoy the process. When I started, I knew it would be a long journey and now we're at a point where we can have fun with our work.

Eric: It's crucial to have fun where you can.

Tim: Definitely. I see it as a slingshot strategy. You grind until you reach a certain point, and then you can just have fun. We reached that point about three months ago.

Simon: So, how do you think your professional pitch is going?

Tim: I hope I come across as succinct and to the point.

Eric: You're doing a great job of tying in different concepts and simplifying language.

Tim: We're on the same page; you want to invest in Alex's venture.

Simon: And you're willing to risk your money on it.

Eric: You both are exactly the partners I've been seeking. It'll be a fun journey with potential challenges. 

Simon: I've already sacrificed a lot for this, so I'm in.

Tim: We need to start first thing tomorrow morning. 

Simon: How did you guys meet?

Eric: It's easier to invest as an investor.

Simon: It's common among venture teams.

Eric: Brisbane and Sydney will eventually merge into one city, but it's a 100-year plan.

Simon: Infrastructure growth is slow.

Tim: In the late sixties, a traffic advisor from San Francisco suggested cutting off public transport and building highways.

Tim: It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now it's problematic. Brisbane built one freeway, cut off some train stations, and discontinued the tram. Now they're facing challenges.

Eric: When it comes to first-time site managers or other partners, I prefer to stay quiet unless I've worked with them long enough to understand their situation and offer valuable advice. Giving general observations and recommendations can be more harmful than beneficial.

Tim: As a founder, people are always seeking advice. They often preface their statements with disclaimers, highlighting that it's just their opinion. But the moment their words are put on a reported platform or online, everything gets misconstrued.

Simon: It creates a divide where some people are comfortable speaking on camera, while others, who perhaps should be speaking, opt to stay silent.

Tim: I'd argue for you to keep sharing your personal account, including your background and experiences, while also acknowledging that you're not always right. General feedback can be helpful, and if the audience knows your area of expertise, they can use your advice accordingly.

Simon: That makes sense.

Tim: If you want to know more about what we do, you can scan this QR code.

Eric: Is this the email I should send?

Tim: Yes, this is for people I meet in person.

Simon: It's a neat concept.

Tim: I'm considering potential name rebrands, by the way. I've also been working on a crude business AI that can help with organisation and documentation. Any suggestions are welcome.

Tim: I've set up a voice recording function to discuss business elements, tasks, and assignments. At the end of every day, it processes the information into categories for my team to see.

Tim: We got a New Zealand-based business, Univers flag, in the architectural space. Have you guys discussed it?

Simon: It's an interesting space. Architects are unique.

ConceptV is an innovative young company with a set of interesting solutions for interior designers. We were recommended to ConceptV by one of our clients, and after meeting with them and discussing the possibilities, they offered us a free proof of concept.  
 
Creating a design for a client takes a lot of back and forth, and we often run into problems where a client doesn’t fully comprehend what we’re proposing. In those situations, it can get difficult and time consuming to communicate our design and get useful responses.  
 
Our design process has mostly revolved around 2D  images we capture from Sketchup and reference images for the mood and style we’re envisioning. It works, but we can’t fully express and get feedback on what the intent is as we’re limited to what’s available and 
affordable.  
 
With ConceptV’s virtual tours  proposals should be much easier, especially for clients who aren’t very good at visualising. Their platform works with all the software we use, and the fact it’s readily available should make it much easier delivering proposals. We’re able to build in information panels inside the tour, so anything we need to explain or point out to the client is right there for them to see.  
 
We can also use tours of our projects to boost our marketing. Having this up on our website or sending one over to a potential client gives us a strong point of difference and could easily generate new business.  
 
The proof of concept was a great exercise to test how we work together, and how we can improve the end result. Since we’ve received the tour, we’ve had a couple of feedback sessions to discuss some redesign areas, learn about new tools and also to plan for more efficient future collaboration. 
 
From a pricing perspective, the prices we’ve been given are affordable and tailored to each 
project. By using ConceptV, we can reduce a lot of the non-design work we currently do in house.  
 
We’ll be using an updated version of this tour in our portfolio and on our website, to show the idea to other clients and attract more high-end business. We are working towards building the cost of the virtual tours into our fees, as an optional project delivery option. We believe that future clients will be excited to see their projects come to life with an interactive model, and that many will pay the extra cost for it.  
 
ConceptV is bringing a much needed change to how design projects can be presented and shared between professionals and clients. We support their application for the Ignite Ideas Fund.

Re: Concept V Reference.  
 
I met ConceptV in February 2022, at the Independent Builders Network conference in Bendigo. They were showing their product, and we talked a bit about it. Since then, I’ve kept in touch with Tim and we’ve recently engaged them.   
 
There’s usually 3 main ways to capture business as a builder: referrals, marketing and displays. I’ve seen an increased use of Matterport tours on other builder’s webpages since Covid, which is great to allow people to see the homes in full capacity. We’ve got hundreds of plans that we offer to our customers which we’re constantly adding to and it’s not feasible for us to get Matterport tours for our plans. We’d need to build a lot of displays, or make them once we finish a client home, but they’re almost always custom, not furnished and have a very long lead time.    
We offer hundreds of plans as well as bespoke plans to our clients. A lot of our clients struggle to understand what their home is going to look like from floor plans and colour swatches, which can lead to a lot of indecision and variation requests.    
I’ve seen a few of the big builders using virtual reality or big screens in their displays, 
but without the resources, the reach and the time they have it’s not something we can feasibly do. At the moment, we also don’t have a display home.   
Until I met Tim and Jackie from ConceptV, there wasn’t really anything available other than facade renders, colour swatches and floor plans to market our plans and guide our clients through design.    
 
The product ConceptV are bringing to market gives us new ways to compete against larger builders. It means we can have virtual display homes we can host anywhere, putting our sales people on equal footing with the larger builders. Further, their product is capable of showing multiple different options inside the virtual tour, meaning we can easily show customers the different options available to them for each design.   
We engaged ConceptV in July with a discount to create five virtual tours of new designs we’re bringing to market. We’re looking at it as a trial to see how we can utilise the technology in the business. We’ll be using it initially in three areas: digital marketing campaigns, on the website and in person with our sales team.   
We can use their product in multiple different parts of the business, we gain a 
competitive advantage and it’s something we can feasibly afford. There are many more ways we can upgrade the tours for new purposes, and I’m looking forward to testing it in our business and seeing how it evolves.    
We are happy to recommend ConceptV for the Ignite Ideas fund, as they’re bringing a unique set of tools for the home building industry.

To whom it may concern, 
 
Tim called me in July this year after Michael Pikos from Pikos Developments, gave him my number. Tim asked to meet with me and discuss my experience regarding off -the-plan sales for new developments.   
 
In my experience, clients find it challenging to fully understand spaces that haven’t been built yet. Trying to explain how the entry flows into the living space, or how pleasant the walk is from the swimming pool back to their home  can be incredibly challenging and subdue their value perception of the property.  
 
We’ve seen mixed results from trying other visualisation methods, such as providing more imagery, videos,  or virtual reality. Other than logistical integration challenges, these only painted a partial picture of the lifestyle we were trying to sell. Clients  were still unable to envision their potential life, and it’s difficult to guide them through the process when they’re not emotionally connected.  
 
Other interactive technologies are limited to when we see a client in person, at the office or display. Getting them there and  keeping them engaged after they leave are completely different challenges. Once they go back home, they rely on memory to talk it over with others and come to a purchase decision. As a result, there are often over 80 points of contact before a client buys an off-plan property.   

After seeing some examples and discussing possibilities with Tim, I think ConceptV can bring a unique solution to this problem. 
Their platform is available everywhere, which opens the possibility to have effective consultations both inside and outside the displays and reach potential buyers anywhere. It’s holistic and highly interactive, so we can tailor how  we show the development to different buyer profiles, and we’re able to dynamically respond to clients' questions and feedback during a meeting. All our existing sales and marketing material can be built into the tour, so we can find everything we need as we’re ‘walking’ through.   
One of the main things that impressed me was how multifunctional their products are. We can chop and change parts of the Virtual Tour and send it out, post it online, and integrate it with our brochures. We can generate images , link QR codes, and connect it to display screens. That gives us a variety of engaging material for clients in all stages, from prospecting and enquiries to continuing sales motivation post -meeting and post -sale. This is the first product of its kind that I’ve come across, and I am looking forward to further exploring how it can benefit our sales process.  
I have arranged a trial with an active development we’ve been commissioned for in Taringa, Brisbane. I have not seen a product this versatile and dynamic available in the industry, and I believe it will bring significant benefit to GAP Development Sales and companies like it.

I wanted to give my website visitors a tool that they could use to test different design and 
finish options, and configure a kit home that suits their needs. We’ve been in touch with ConceptV since they started in 2019 and have given them feedback on their product as it 
evolved. 
  
Since Covid, we see lot more online purchases of our kits, and we want to capitalise on that 
momentum. We had a quoting system made for it, but customers still couldn’t see what the options they’d chosen actually looked like. I was talking to Tim about this at the start of 2022, 
and when he told me his platform could now generate exactly what we needed, we agreed to 
do a discounted initial trial. 
 
 They delivered it to us a few months later, fully configured to connect with our new quoting system and doing exactly what we wanted. 
 
 
The selector ConceptV developed for us shows an instant visual and pricing update on the 
different variables we offer. We operate in quite a few countries, and now customers can just go to our website, choose a plan, select their configuration and instantly see what it looks like and what it costs. We’re looking at this as a way to create a new revenue stream, completely automated sales from the website. 
  
This tool is a much-needed solution for our sales processes. Since COVID-19 started, 
people want to see and do more activities online. This includes the freedom of planning their design without relying on a consultant, in their own time. Our selector can reach people anywhere, anytime. It’s very easy to use, and there’s nothing like it out there, which gives us 
a unique advantage over our competition. 
 
ConcepV’s unique product has changed how much we can achieve with the business. 
Having a completely interactive viewer that’s linked up to our quoting system is a game changer. People from all over the world can go to our website, choose and configure one of our kits and buy it. We’ve already ordered another 8, and we’re aiming to update all our designs over time.

To the assessors of the Ignite Ideas grant,  
My wife and I commenced  the journey of designing our new home with a leading Queensland architect on our Scarborough property at the start of  2020. The house is highly personalised  requiring over 12 months of design investment in time and energy, partnering with several  professionals. Eventually we reached a point where my wife and I felt we had captured the true essence of the home and design details, so we approached ConceptV back in early 2021 after introductions from a mutual friend.  
Tim was testing new internal processes and offered an attractive proof of concept proposal for our new home  in exchange for feedback and permission to use the resulting work for  marketing  purposes. The concept was great, and I was very excited to see it once it came together.   
Our project was reasonably  complex with a sloping block, over four levels with a design  requiring a high degree  of engineering.  The architect, Chris Clout Design,  provided comprehensive  sets of floor plans, elevations, joinery designs, finishing schedules and a few rendered images.  These along with other details from general discussions and site visits were passed on to Tim and his team.  
A few weeks later Tim called and sent me a text ink to what he called a “work in progress”. It appeared to be 95% complete to me. The realism, attention to detail and ability scan around in every direction brought the home to life. The solution required no training, and by its very nature, is exceptionally intuitive.   
We had invested 12 months  in the homes’ design  with a leading Australian architect. I went through the virtual tour again on my phone at home.  I spent 90 minutes  with it and discovered 21 items requiring further attention via Tim’s solution. There are aspects that would be extremely difficult to identify if it wasn’t for taking a realistic and detailed walk -through of the home with the ability to view both interiors and exteriors from almost any perspective.  As a result,  we felt much more confident about the design with the virtual tour. I could easily share with my friends and family to get their opinions, text the link and easily communicate to 
anyone at any time . 
The house is currently under construction by GRAYA. I passed the virtual tour to Pete r Richardson, the foreman, who uses it every  day on site. Having the tour on site with access for all key trades allows everyone to visualise the result, understand the larger picture and prevent mistakes  or misunderstandings potentially resulting in additional costs.  
ConceptV’s platform is highly valuable,  and I  am actively recommending it to other building and design professionals .  
Having an interactive visualisation tool had a significant positive impact on our project, from making the right design decisions up front, to involving my friends and family , through to day-to-day management decisions  and effective cost management.  I believe they have a unique product that has incredible potential 
to succeed in the design and building sectors.

Reds Group (Property Developer)

Who: Jason Blair (Property Director for Reds Group)
When: 26 August 2022
Why: Recommendation letter in support of investment
To whom it may concern, 
 
Reds Group is a commercial development company delivering community-oriented spaces across Queensland.

A project's design is the combined effort of architects, engineers, interior designers, lighting designers, landscape designers, and many other moving parts, all with a common goal: designing a space fit for its purpose. With so many stakeholders involved, we experience significant difficulties that largely boil down to the efficiency and timeliness of design communication. Everyone has their own intellectual property (IP), their own software, and no one owns the whole thing. As a result, there's a high level of risk for errors when it's all brought together.

When those errors are caught, there's a significant back-and-forth between revisions and reviews. When they're not, they show up during construction or post-completion, leading to rework, late-stage alterations, or an end result that isn't effectively designed for purpose. In any case, those design errors end up costing large amounts of both time and money.

Another difficulty we face during design is communicating design intent to the designers.

"I want buildings that belong and look like they've been there for a long time. Having the view on how we want the facades to look, in context, at the earliest stages will save a great amount of time in policing what the architects are doing later on. Because it's hard to manage what the architect thinks is the right method for designing a shop." - Jason Blair, Property Director of Reds Group

We engaged Tim from ConceptV in November 2021 for a trial on one of our active projects in Everton Park. Tim was introduced by a business associate who had trialed ConceptV's services and recommended we have a meeting. After explaining the difficulties we have, Tim provided us with a proposal for how his platform could help address those problems. We accepted Tim's proposal for a 6-week trial on our P6 project, which was in the work-up phase at the time.

ConceptV was provided with the requested files, and Tim was nominated as one of our project leads for the project. Tim was to be involved in fortnightly design discussions with the other project leads, updating the tour with new information, suggesting and developing tools based on feedback from the team.

In the 6 weeks after ConceptV's platform was delivered, the team discovered:

A disparity of revisions between the architect, kitchen designer, and bar design.
An element of the kitchen design impeding communication flow amongst kitchen staff by the head chef.
A kitchen rack with incorrect dimensions that would not fit in the space.
Since the trial ended, we contracted ConceptV to continue evolving the platform with design progress, and they are designing additional functions specifically built for our projects and process.

The tour has been highly beneficial as a communication tool, especially among the many non-technical stakeholders. Explaining the project in financial, legal, and client meetings is much easier and is far more comprehensible in a holistic sense than technical plans alone.

We're looking at this as a potential solution to the difficulties outlined above. With the understanding that the platform will evolve to fit new uses, we intend on utilizing the virtual tour during the remainder of the design, during construction, as part of our marketing, and as a tool visitors of the development can use to find helpful information while there. From what we've experienced so far, the unique platform ConceptV has developed will likely fulfill its objective and go on to deliver further value in additional stages of the development process.

We've already engaged ConceptV for another development in Redcliffe (Reds Group - Redcliffe) after discussing the advantages of using their platform from the very start of a project, allowing us to develop the concept design with respect to the surrounding environment. They later provided us a proposal with custom-made tools, which we accepted.
"One of the biggest costs in the business is building things when surrounding elements haven't been considered properly. Often people can't afford to rebuild, so they have to learn to live with the mistakes or mask them. The Digital Tour is making us think about the space as a whole before we build it, avoiding mistakes and profit loss. That's ultimately the value of the 3D model compared to traditional methods." - Jason Blair, Property Director of Reds Group.

There have been teething problems during the process, which were not unexpected, but overall, the tour provided by ConceptV has had a positive impact on our process and has helped identify design issues that would have been incredibly difficult otherwise. To date, we have not seen anything else like it in the market. It is a unique product that has the potential to bring significant time and cost savings to our business.

"Success' for this partnership means that we're able to use the model all the time as we're planning the venue, building it visually before incurring the construction cost. It's also a matter of managing the input level from everyone - and making the model work." - Jason Blair.

After using it for the last 10 months, we're impressed with the potential and have begun implementing it on other projects. We have seven other active projects for which we intend to bring ConceptV on board.

"The practical use of this platform has some incredible efficiencies, especially considering we tend to use the same team for multiple projects. I want to reduce the scope of the designers and get their input later rather than earlier, as their method of work is very rigid and hard to make changes without going out of the tender. From a business perspective, we need more time and certainty to assess viability before committing to a certain design." - Jason Blair.

We believe that ConceptV's unique innovation has considerable application in the property industry, and we look forward to continuing to work with them.
 
 
Yours sincerely

To whom it may concern,  

I am a private investor with experience across some of the world’s largest investment funds, including recently as part of Aware Super’s Real Estate investment team, where I engaged in direct equity investment and portfolio management of a multibillion-dollar property portfolio. I had the pleasure of investing in ConceptV in April of this year, having first become familiar with the Company in 2018 when it was in an early conceptual stage. I have been extremely impressed with the progress Tim has made since this time, and the opportunity to partner with him as an investor and advisor has me excited for the future trajectory of the Company.  As an advisor, I have been able to bring my wealth of institutional investment, due diligence, and real estate sector knowledge to partner with ConceptV and provide Tim with strategic guidance as the Company pursues its ambitious next stage of growth. The market for Prop Tech is significant and growing, and my investment was based on a fundamental belief that Concept V offers an enduring value proposition to stakeholders across the property value chain. I have seen firsthand as an institutional investor how the construction and development process is cumbersome, unwieldy, and costly.  By disintermediating the design and construction process with its innovative  Virtual Tour offering, Concept V has global potential to support a range of industry stakeholders, including architects, developers, builders, occupants,  and investors, to improve the efficiency of the industry overall. ConceptV ’s commercialisation has proven promising since the time of my investment and has been based on a well-considered strategic approach to the management of organisational growth and change. Tim has built an extensive network across not only the property industry but has drawn on appropriate legal, financial and technical support in order to execute his strategy. I have been consistently impressed with Ti ’s purposive approach with respect to  scaling ConceptV and his prudent deployment of capital to support the operational expansion and improvement of a variety of internal functions . Among these include:  

Sales  – in growing ConceptV ’s client base over the course of 20 22 with reputable and high-quality counterparties in line with the go-to-market strategy and service rollout; 
Operations and deliverance  – in ensuring personnel growth has been tailored to support recognised and critical business needs; and  
Product and technology – through a focus on iterating and improving the Virtual Tour offering to generate both time and cost efficiencies internally whilst responding to end-user demand and improving the product experience. 

In implementing the go-to-market strategy, Tim has consistently demonstrated a willingness to take onboard feedback and pivot to the most prospective and pressing requirements facing the Company. In doing so, he has been able to drive the best outcomes for his clients, staff and investors, which will serve him well as the commercialisation phase continues to ramp up. I am excited by the potential for the Ignite Ideas Fund to accelerate the growth of ConceptV ’s commercialisation. Today, Concept V services a range of residential property players whilst partly tapping into the commercial property market. I have seen first-hand, working in conjunction with Australia’s largest property players, including Lendlease, how the Virtual Tour offering can provide efficiency advantages across not only the residential, but also the office, retail, and industrial sectors. The ease of accessibility and configurability related to the visual outputs it produces is unmatched in the market, especially from a cost standpoint, and its applications have the potential to disrupt not only key elements of property design but also extend to property and construction management and serve as a key tool for enhancing the occupant experience and investor due diligence. Invest or Letter of Recommendation  28 August 2022  
A grant from the Ignite Ideas Fund will see Concept V able to accelerate its current 
commercialisation and growth strategies in order to serve these critical adjacent markets in a much shorter timeframe than would otherwise be possible.  In doing so, the grant will enhance ConceptV ’s ability to promote future funding rounds, in turn supporting more rapid innovation and the creation of sustainable high-tech jobs. Today, ConceptV is not a nebulous idea on a page but a very real service on the cusp of transforming the property industry if provided with the appropriate runway to support its growth. 
As a Queensland native, it is always encouraging to see homegrown products and services with broad national and international applicability. ConceptV is ideally positioned to support not only the State’s booming construction industry over the next decade but global innovation across the property value chain. I continue to be excited by ConceptV ’s potential and Tim’s impressive capabilities as a founder and CEO in executing his vision for the betterment of one of  Queensland’s, Australia’s and the world’s most important industries.  

Yours sincerely,  
Sean McBurnie

[Market-Opportunity] [Design-Collaboration] [Networking-Event]
Architects & Interior Designers 
Weian Lim - Director - 
“ConceptV has the potential to be a game-changing innovation in the way architects and building designers can further  client engagement. Developing an intuitive and interactive tool, that puts the design quite literally in the palm of our clients’  hands, immediately elevates their level of involvement and input to make the project experience a truly collaborative  endeavour.” 

Wayne Greenland - Director - 
“Utilising the platform from ConceptV was incredibly easy. It took our design ideas & brought our 3D renders to life to  communicate with the clients. It was great for the clients to have a user friendly platform they had ownership of to show to  their own friends & family.”

Steven Bishop - Director at SJ Bishop Architects 
“Having this kind of centralised system really helps when coordinating projects with engineers.”

Demis Roussos - Director - 
“I was very impressed with the quality and level of detail produced in the ConceptV presentation, as were my clients.  Looking forward to using it on my next project.” 

Evan Pickering - Director - 
“We’ve used other visualisation software before such as Enscape but ConceptV’s product is much easier to produce and  far more effective.” 

Andrew Milward-Bason - Director - 
“The innovation that ConceptV are bringing to the market enables communication on a whole new scale. With their  technology, we would be able to curate economically viable design principles for suburban living through wide facing  communication and feedback from the public.” 
Barbara Albert - Director -
“Creating a design for a client takes a lot of back and forth, and we often run into problems where a client doesn’t fully  comprehend what we’re proposing. ConceptV is bringing a much needed change to how design projects can be presented  and shared between professionals and clients.” 

Home Builders 
Mat Dagg - New Home Consultant - 
“ConceptV’s Virtual Tour allowed my clients to make a detailed list of changes in a single round. My design process has  been streamlined from the reduced variation requests.” 
Keith Richardson - General Manager - 
“This tool is a much-needed solution for our sales processes. Since COVID-19 started, people want to see and do more  activities online. This includes the freedom of planning their design without relying on a consultant, in their own time. Our  selector can reach people anywhere, anytime. It’s very easy to use, and there’s nothing like it out there.” 
Pete Richardson - Site Supervisor -  
“During the construction phase, interpreting plans and renders can be quite challenging. With ConceptV, the intuitive 3D  model of the Seachange project has brought to life what our client has envisioned for their home, making complex design  decisions easier onsite, saving money and time.” 
Luke Shephard - Director - 
“The product ConceptV is bringing to market gives us new ways to compete against larger builders. It means we can  have virtual display homes we can host anywhere, putting our sales people on equal footing with the larger builders.  Further, their product is capable of showing multiple different options inside the virtual tour, meaning we can easily show  customers the options available to them for each design.” 
Property Developers & Sales Specialists 
Luke Shephard - Director - 
“The Virtual Tour is making us think about the space as a whole, before we build it, avoiding mistakes and profit loss.  That’s ultimately the value of the 3D model if compared to traditional methods.”  
Grant Plummer - Director - 
“One of the main things that impressed me was how multifunctional their products are. We can chop and change parts of  the Virtual Tour and send it out, post it online, and integrate it with our brochures. We can generate images, link QR codes,  and connect it to display screens. That gives us a variety of engaging material for clients in all stages.” 
Eloisa Greenham - Marketing Manager - 
“People are really able to understand and tangibly see what they’re getting.” 
End Clients 
Diana & Peter French - New home buyers - QLD 
“If we had a Virtual Tour available in the early stages of our planning process, our queries could have been covered over the  course of one or two meetings, saving us the several backs-and-forwards during the planning process.” 
Nick F. - New home buyer - QLD 
“It’s a fantastic tool and so easy to use. It has provided us with a unique perspective on how our new house will look.” 
Alan & Skye H. - Architect clients - QLD 
“We already had the BIMx model that we were using but ConceptV’s Virtual Tour was more detailed and realistic.  Thoroughly enjoyed using the program.” 
Investors & Advisors 
Sean McBurnie - Investor and Advisor at ConceptV 
“I have seen firsthand as an institutional investor how the construction and development process is cumbersome, unwieldy,  and costly. By disintermediating the design and construction process with its innovative Virtual Tour offering, ConceptV  has global potential to support a range of industry stakeholders, including architects, developers, builders, occupants, and  investors, to improve the efficiency of the industry overall.” 
Lindsay Birley - End client and Investor at ConceptV
“Having an interactive visualisation tool had a significant positive impact on our project, from making the right design  decisions up front, to involving my friends and family, through to day-to-day management decisions and effective cost  management. ConceptV’s platform is highly valuable, and I am actively recommending it to other building and design  professionals.”

Competitor Meeting Notes 
[Competitor-Analysis] [Market-Strategy]
SpecifierLab

Who: ﻿Ben Powell (CEO of SpecifierLab) - Indirect Competitor
When: 18 May 2022
Why: Analysis of product offering and service structure from indirect competitor, operating in Australia
They offer 2 different types of services
* A publishing software, which is like a sandbox tool for users to manipulate files exported from Revit, Archicad, etc. This is essentially free for members of their network and they don’t really make money from it.
* Enterprise solutions - these are custom tools and solutions developed to meet the needs of their biggest clients. This is where the money comes from. 

Check their iDesign by CSR, these are visualisers with custom preset styles and filters developed for their clients. Examples: https://visualiser.gyprock.com.au/gyprock and  https://monier.csridesign.com.au/56da71dd-53e6-403d-bf27-ffdc4646bf57.

This software has been in the making for several years, with the oldest client being with the company for 8 years.Their focus is to establish a network of builders, designers, suppliers, etc. They’ve signed some pretty big companies and get/distribute a lot of work based on referrals. Their goal is to form long-term relationships.Their finishes and surfaces are from real Australian suppliers, like Coco Republic, Cemintel and Monier. They don’t do any modelling or client work in house - if a client needs someone to manipulate their software, they’ll refer them to someone on the network.
Ben mentioned a few times they don’t use any gaming engines, so it’s all render tech (which he described as more powerful and realistic).
When using the software, the user can assign finishes to all surfaces (it reads labels from the cad list and automatically selects different surfaces). The user can also select which surfaces will be “dynamic” - so the end user can change finishes. That might be the roof, the walls, cornice, etc.
The user can also control lighting, apply filters to the scene and furnish the rooms.
The software looks sophisticated, is easy to use and has a decent library. 
It takes about 8 minutes to “dress up” a house with basic surroundings (external only).
If the architect needs to change the file (such as change kitchen layout or move a wall), the software will save the details and update the work, so the user doesn’t need to start from scratch.
The user cannot change the background, but it’s possible to export the renders and orbits with transparent background for photoshop post-production.
There’s no limit to file size, he showed me an example of the Melbourne CBD uploaded to the software. Files uploaded to the software are all cloud-based. Users can export their work as standard links or APIs. They also have an Analytics portal. They don’t do interactive tours, but the user can export “orbits”, which are essentially 360 renders. To move from one room to another you go to the next image.

Ben admitted that this might not be the best option for one-off projects. Better for project homes, where there are 100’s of designs and combinations of finishes to be exported.
We’re not exactly competing on the same market, but they have a great advantage when it comes to larger developments and some of our long-term target markets. Similar solutions to what we envisioned for our Switch platform.


Lucid Vue
Who: ﻿Brooke Smith (Sales agent for Lucid Vue) - Direct Competitor
When: 23 May 2022
Why: Analysis of product offering and service structure from direct competitor, operating in Australia
Similar process to ours, in which they get the 3D files and go from there. They have the ability to do modelling in house, but the more 3D supplied, the cheaper the project.
To quote for a project, they receive and analyse the files to assess the amount of work, discuss requirements, then aim to send a quote back in 24h. There are no hidden costs.
Pricing ballpark was around 15k for a 2 bed apartment and up to 17k for a 3 bed apartment. That’s for a fully interactive tour, but without any custom functions, such as colour change. 
A full house costs a bit more, but usually stays under 20k.
Their clients with bigger developments will hardly model more than 2-3 units. Common areas (like an entry hall, entertaining room, bbq area) vary in price, usually from 5-10k each. She estimated the average pool area with some lounges and landscaping will cost around 5-7k.
They have 2 interior designers that can plan for the whole interior design, from scratch, or take their own direction with the project after a discussion on what we’re aiming for, target demographics, etc. They usually charge a “a few grand”  for the interior design service, but she reassured it’s not too expensive.
Delivery times range from 4-6 weeks for the average full project. Most projects are delivered within 4 weeks.
The Niseko project took 6 months, as the clients loved the tech and kept adding rooms to the scope. https://lucidvue.com/case-studies/niseko-virtual-tour/
Variations are not included, but usually cost between $350 - 550 each. They can also package those depending on the project requirements.
Virtual Tours are delivered as links/source code, so it can be texted or embedded on websites. There are no hosting fees, and tours can be hosted for an unlimited time.
Virtual Tours are compatible with any internet-connected device.
They also do rendering in-house, usually 1.5k-2k for an interior image, and around 3k for an external image. These get creeper if they do the Virtual Tour first.
They also have a tour specifically for architects with one-off projects. This is what they call a “white box” tour: rooms are not furnished and the finishes/lighting aren’t as sophisticated. It is essentially a lower resolution version, as architects and their clients are mostly interested in the overall spaces. 

They can quote more detailed areas separately, such as kitchen and bathrooms, depending on the client's interest.
This bare-bones tour usually costs around 3-5k.

Their whole tour interface was designed to be easy to navigate for the older population (around 60-80yo). Lifestyle communities are a big part of what they do.
They can work on custom tour features if required.

They’re targeting the same markets as our short and long term plans, but seem to have a solid client base and a fair number of enquiries. All the work is done in house.

They’ve been getting really good feedback and engagement from real estate agents. They usually text the client the tour link. No mention of QR codes.


Snaploader
Who: ﻿Eric Fink (CEO of Snaploader and Archistar) - Direct Competitor
When: 24 May 2022
Why: Analysis of product offering and service structure from direct competitor, operating in Australia
Most of their clients are property developers, but they also welcome private residential work.
Their client base is in Australia, US and UK.

They've been doubling their team every 6 months, enquiries are out of control, with a lot of repeat clients. Production capacity doesn’t seem to be a problem, but projects have to be booked in advance.
Not much of a cost difference if we give them 2D plans or 3D files. This is because they need to redo the whole model in their own system in order to simplify the plans. This process is similar to tracing.
Interestingly, they need to do a fly-through first to be able to generate a 360 tour. He called them Step 1 and Step 2, as they’d need to create the 360 scenes for the video, so adding the tour from there becomes quite cheap.
Delivery timeframes for the average development project is 6 weeks. Around 4 weeks if it’s just a single house.
They don’t factor design modifications in their process. Any redesign requests have to be quoted individually after the 3D model is delivered - it depends on how many hours it will take them to modify it.
They don’t have the ability to do any CGI in-house. What they do is create a gallery inside the tour using renders/collateral they get from the developer’s marketing team.
They also don’t take 360 drone shots for the surroundings. They have guidelines to provide to clients, or a guy that he can recommend in QLD.

Eric also said that a lot of people start small (like 1 floor or 1 apartment), end up loving the technology and come back for more. They seem to have a lot of return clients, including Allhomes (owned by Domain). 

They prioritise showcasing the whole development with every apartment floorplan over high-quality graphics. Completely different approach to Lucid Vue.

Their clients are getting very positive feedback from home buyers - they find it logical to follow, and get more clarity on how the buildings flow/look like.

The visuals are definitely not the greatest, but pricing is competitive and they make up for it with some of the functions and sales tools. They prepare nice proposals with images and descriptions instead of handing out quotes.
   
They have a few tools designed specifically for pre-sales, which includes their own version of a markup tool and analytics portal. They have developed an app for sales agents, which can be offered in conjunction with a tablet. They charge extra for installation and training.

They have the ability to update sale status (sold/available) live for their floorplan tours. That creates urgency and clients can actually see which units are still available.

Snaploader’s CEO is also behind Archistar. They capture developers early - at the stage of finding suitable sites - then offer them the sales package when the design is done.

Rendivo
Who: Matthew Lester (Director of Rendivo) - Indirect Competitor
When: 26 September 2022
Why: Analysis of product offering and service structure from indirect competitor, operating in Australia
Rendivo is a SAAS (Software as a service) Visualisation web app for home builders and building material suppliers.
Clients are using Rendivo for a number of key applications for both internal and public use including:
* Colour room and selections pipeline integration
* Generation of custom marketing imagery
* Public web visualiser for customer portals or public guests

See platform features in this QWILR visual presentation: https://rendivo.qwilr.com/RENDIVO-Generic-Feature-Summary-2019-Y9bOcobQ2erB
A couple of live clients. Some have video presentations about the service:
* Clarendon Homes: https://www.clarendon.com.au/nsw/facade-styler
* Brickworks Limited: https://australbricks.com.au/ivisualise

Clients are able to pick and choose which Materials, Selections and Options they would like applied to each home (exterior or interior) - and on what parts and areas of each house.
They have 100,000's of selections already in the Rendivo database from all of the major Australian suppliers (similar to SpecifierLab). They maintain all supplier selections on behalf of clients to ensure customers have access to all their selections in Rendivo.
If something is missing that a client needs - they will add it at no cost.
Clients can apply filters to only include the products/finishes they offer.

Once subscribed, clients and their customers can create, share and download an unlimited number of renders, brochures and social site posts from any possible house configuration.
Other features include Customer Management, Analytics, API Connections, Sharing options and more.

ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION FEES

There are 2x cost elements to any Rendivo service:
1. The yearly subscription fee to access the service from your website/colour rooms
2. Once-off cost of producing content (House scenes) to add to your subscription.
Clients pay a subscription fee to access the service.
Clients then pay once-off fees to have content (House Exteriors and Interiors) produced for the service - just like ordering normal renders - but they are fully configurable.
Once subscribed, the app can be easily integrated into websites, and users can output an unlimited number of renders with any applied colour selections. 
They look after all hosting, content management, database and server considerations with a 99.99% SLA.

Quick overview of pricing and packages below. They also have custom packages for larger volumes of homes.

Rendivo 'Basic' 10:  $21,990 per year (inc GST)
Fixed provisioning for up to 10 Homes (Interiors or Exteriors)

Rendivo 'Standard' 25:  $34,990 per year (inc GST)
