ConceptV Team Meeting 9/05/2023


Tim: Thank you all for coming. This meeting is critical as we need to discuss the company's status. There are three critical factors to starting a company: timing, the product, and networks. Of these, timing is the most challenging to get right. 


We built the company using the lean startup methodology, bootstrapping it with a total of $200K over six years. Our financing strategy comprised of investment, the research and development tax incentive, and sales. 


In June, we entered the soft launch stage, expecting it to last 12-18 months. However, due to overwhelming interest, we expedited the timeline, necessitating the hiring of additional team members. 


Recently, managing my time has become a challenge, given my numerous responsibilities. This difficulty extends to juggling immediate, medium, and long-term objectives, especially cash flow management. 


We've managed to run the company for six years without missing any payrolls, a rare achievement for startups. However, the next month could be challenging. 


In our three-month pipeline, we anticipate about $160K in revenue from various sources. Despite this, we're experiencing a short-term cash gap. 


Typically, companies have an overdraft facility, but due to our company's stage, securing one is challenging. An initial plan fell through, leaving us in a difficult financial position. 


We have about $100K confirmed through R&D and a $250K commitment, among other potential income sources. Despite the current challenge, we are very close to a significant breakthrough. 


To navigate this situation, we have several strategies. We have numerous outstanding invoices, which, once issued, could generate a minimum of $20K. 


The rest of my week is dedicated to networking meetings with VC people in Sydney and a developer summit. I need your help in organizing all the materials I require. 


Specifically, Liam, I need you to retrieve 3D files from previous emails. Jordy, I need you to review recent emails to ensure we have all the necessary materials.


Liam, I need you to estimate the time required for the project outlined in our emails and the previous proposal. Adjust the proposal based on the new information. 


Jay, assess if you have all the information for the fitouts. Determine what you need and where to get the furniture. Give me an estimate for the required budget and any additional requirements. Liaise with Liam before our 4:30 meeting and have questions ready. 


Next, review all material from Angela, assuming a similar level of modeling quality to the PDF. For Angela's project and the OPD one, consider stage delivery. For OPD, time is critical, so create a layout-quality tour as soon as possible.


Michael, coordinate with Liam and Jackie on your work schedule. For the Angela project, due for the AIA in a month, prepare three different quality levels using a style switcher. Provide estimates for these and ensure invoices are sent out by midday tomorrow.


In terms of additional funding, I'll discuss bridging finance with our initial investors. I have meetings set with Lindsay this weekend and two more early next week. Jackie and I will plan for our conversation with Lindsay. 


We are close to achieving significant breakthroughs. There's Tamara's project, the AIA meeting, potential investment and jobs from Mode Architecture, commercial fitout opportunities, and others. Despite the cash flow issue, I'm confident we'll navigate this situation successfully.


I apologize for letting you down and failing in my responsibilities. If you have any questions, please ask. We're all navigating new territory here.


Jackie: I'll be handling quote files among other tasks.


Tim: Most of the files just require PDF conversion, except for OPD and Angela's, which need full proposals. We'll need to prioritize tasks as this might delay some opportunities. We could potentially push the AIA event back.


Jackie: That's feasible since they have three other events on the same day.


Tim: Excellent. We'll delay it by two weeks. On the VC front, the company's committed value has grown to $4 million from $2.75 million in February. This increase implies that potential investors are willing to invest $250K based on the $4 million valuation. In two months, when we approach VCs, I aim for a $6 million valuation. The progress we've made in three months is incredible. Our development side has made significant strides, particularly in rendering and pipeline system development.


However, time management remains a challenge for me. Consequently, next week's pay might be delayed by up to two weeks. Please bear with the situation and ask any necessary questions. Our communication system needs improvement, which is something we all need to work on. 


I've set up a virtual assistant to automatically convert our meeting into a report and action items, which should enhance our communication. 


In terms of tasks, Luke's invoice needs to be paid, although he could only afford half.


Jackie: Should I have started on the splash screen?


Tim: That was decided last night. Also, Michael, I mentioned a splash screen for the QR code. Jackie's already started on it. I need you to take the mockup with six tours and add the video and one-pager. After that, please work on a landing page as soon as possible. I'm meeting with the network tomorrow, and having the landing page ready would be fantastic.
