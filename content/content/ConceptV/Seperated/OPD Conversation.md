OPD (prospective client) Conversation between Tim from ConceptV to Jim at OPD:


Jim: Hi, I'm Jim Stevenson.
Tim: Hi Jim, I'm Tim from Concert V. Nice to finally meet you. I've had insightful conversations with Bill and Tolleson, giving me an understanding of your operations.


Jim: We usually meet customers at the buildings they're interested in. We provide a fitout plan and showcase our previous projects to demonstrate the quality we can offer. This usually suffices to win their confidence. However, for larger customers purchasing an entire building, we're considering offering a visual walkthrough of the premises.


We've done this before, but never in such detail, tailor-made to the customer's requirements. It's a time-consuming process, so we don't do it for all customers. In this case, I'm thinking of sending the customer the plans now, and ideally, we'll have the walkthrough ready for the next meeting. But, if not, we'll have to keep the momentum going and provide the walkthrough later.


Tim: Considering the importance of time and momentum, we could initially provide a less detailed model, with a pleasant but sketchy feel. Accompanied by a floor plan and reference images, the client could have a week or two to provide their feedback. Then, we can update the model with their revisions, creating a sense of progressive momentum. Does that sound reasonable?


Jim: That does sound good, but I think we may be overestimating the impact of this tool. The majority of what secures a sale is the building's location, its size, the customer's understanding of our services, and securing funding. This VR representation is an added benefit, the cherry on top. If a more detailed VR representation requires additional time, it may need to come after securing the deal. I'm still figuring out where this fits in our process.


Tim: You'll also be handling building 11 down the line. How is progress with 14?


Jim: We've met with the customer for 14 three times. They're interested, and we're now trying to get them to sign the contract and pay the deposit. We could use the VR as a selling point. I'd like to see what you can prepare in a four-day turnaround and what it could evolve into in stage two.


Tim: Four days might be tight due to the work involved, but I can show you examples of our quality. We've developed software over six years that allows us to create custom product lines for different sub-markets. We can research how to integrate seamlessly with your operations. The initial setup is the most work-intensive. If it's only for the fitout, complications might arise. However, the initial system development could be reused for building 11.


Jim: I'm interested in that, but I need to decide about 14 first.


Tim: If you commit to using the system across all projects, I can prioritize getting something out for this project as soon as possible, given the time constraint.


Jim: If you can show me what you can provide, the duration, and cost, I can make a decision quickly.


Tim: Understood. 


Jim: I haven't seen a proposal for this specific task. I know you've worked on building 11, but I haven't seen anything for this fitout.


Tim: We had conversations with Toon about using the system for virtual tours of every fitout and updating it according to client annotations. I can send you that first proposal too.


Jim: I've seen that one, but it's not specific to this fitout and our timeline. 


Tim: It's not cost-efficient to use our comprehensive system for a small task. 


Jim: To simplify, could you send me an email with an attachment showing what I can expect in a four or five business day period and how much it will cost?


Tim: I can send over some details regarding the project's cost, despite not having all the information requested. We have a lot of in-house capabilities, so we need to define the job's scope. It might involve more than just a couple of lines, given the complexity. Consider how this could be used in the future too. 


For instance, if you often show clients around buildings, a full tour with built-in information and multiple options could be useful. This would not require the clients to be physically present. 


Jim: Our selling point is property. Our customers aren’t usually looking for residential properties like two-bedroom, one-bath units in specific locations. Many of those can make purchases using visual representations, particularly if they're not local. However, most of our customers visit our park, and we use these meetings to build their confidence and offer them the asset they're seeking. 


We have an array of buildings to show them once they arrive, which often surpasses any virtual presentation. But having such a tool could be helpful to attract them initially, even though it might not match the detailed brief provided by the customer.


Tim: Our products can be integrated into existing successful practices. Most of the information you provide likely follows the information memorandum template. We don't change that but add enhancements to it. For example, if there's a section discussing different finishes, views, and quality, we can incorporate a QR code or clickable button to show this visually, without leaving the memorandum.


Jim: That sounds good.


Tim: I believe I have a grasp of your timeline and understand how you view this tool's value based on our previous discussions. There are a few more minor points to discuss, but I think I have most of what I need. The scope remains unclear to me. If it's just the fitout and the surrounding area, we'll need to spend some time determining how much of this area is involved and what the fitout design itself should look like.


Tim: Once the system is set up, it can perform various tasks including updating plans within a week. To build excitement and maintain regular communication, you could present the initial concept to the client, asking for feedback before giving a tour. This approach also affords us more time to refine the tour.


Regarding construction, you have a builder and an architect to compile the necessary documentation. Anton, I believe, handles cabinetry and finish specifications, so I will need to speak with him. For landscaping, we already have the site survey, and although we don't have an interior plant schedule yet, it should be acceptable to replicate previous designs.


The specifics won't be finalized until version four of the plan, giving us some creative freedom. We can follow the design, making it attractive, and update it later to match the exact plan. This flexibility should apply to furniture and other elements of the fit-out too.


Could you provide an introductory email to Anton and myself? I will then request the necessary files from him.


For the proposal's first draft, I will incorporate most of what we discussed today, adding a rush fee to the initial part. This is an estimate, but costs could be around $15,000 to $20,000.


Jim: If you can detail what we get for that amount, I can make an informed decision.


Tim: I'll send you that information in an email tomorrow.
