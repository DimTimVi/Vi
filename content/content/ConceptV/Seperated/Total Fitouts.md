Total Fitouts Initial meeting between Tim Geldard, Steve, Jeremy Dyer and Nick from their potential client Total Fitouts from Lindsay introduction, Tim played golf with Jeremy and Lindsay 4 May 2023:


Tim: I'm Tim, and I've been working on a system to streamline property management for about six years now. My journey started when I was pursuing my Bachelor of Property Economics and found myself frustrated by the amount of manual work and frequent errors. This led me to launch my own company where we delve into the psychology of decision-making and information processing, ultimately developing a global system to address these issues.


Our system's primary goal is to rectify inconsistencies with file types and incompatibilities with different programs that often cause pain for users. Our approach is simple: allow end users to upload any files they have, such as PDFs, debit files, IQ cards, etc. We then configure a product system based on these inputs.


Jeremy, I might see if Rob could join us for this discussion. 


Tim: Meanwhile, I'll show you a video to give you an overarching idea of what the client-facing side is.


Tim: Have any of you assembled a video before? It's quite a task. That's what Jane from Marketing does, and it's quite a headache.


Jeremy: I noticed Steve's screen is to the side. 


Tim: Apologies, Steve, you might not be seeing this video.


Steve: You need to share it.


Tim: Should I stop the video?


Jeremy: Yes, stop and reshare it. It's better that way.


Tim: I can also turn down the music.


Jeremy: Just stop sharing and then share again.


Tim: All set? Is the music okay?


Jeremy: It's fine. 


Steve: We've been waiting, you might want to sit down for this.


Tim: Nice to meet you, Rod.


Steve: Rod heads up our operations. You might find our work with software and tech interesting.


Tim: We've worked with a man who started several software companies. It took a month to condense six years of development into a one-minute video for venture capitalists. We're raising one and a half million dollars. It's frustrating to meet all these standards within tight time frames.


Tim: Everything in the video are snippets from live projects. We've used our Property Wizard tool, finished last year, to create different systems for various sectors.


Tim: I started the team when I was 20. We've since added specialists in different parts of software development. We've partnered with industry leaders in luxury development and large-scale architecture. Tamara, a director at the Australian Initiative Architects, will be joining as our Director of Growth soon.


Tim: We've been focusing on implementing our product. Our main goal is to make communication with clients easy and automated. We've developed product systems for various sectors and are in the initial stages of implementing them with some of our partners.


Tim: We're currently raising capital for initiatives in residential architecture and development sales. We've also launched a suppliers portal to connect suppliers with their clients. We're constantly adapting to legal changes as well.


Tim: We're facing an upcoming change, likely by the end of this year, where builders won't be able to deviate from architect specifications. We have strong connections in the supplier industry and are developing a platform to streamline communication. 


Jeremy: This platform could eliminate issues arising from plan changes, and I assume suppliers will be integrated in the future. 


Tim: Absolutely, our system is flexible and can be adapted in various ways. We've also conducted market research on your operations, understanding your objectives, strengths, and what your competitors are doing. Based on our discussions, I've drafted an implementation strategy. 


Jeremy: Go on. 


Tim: One of the challenges you're facing is inconsistency across franchises in terms of client engagement, software use, and 3D design depth. Despite the growing animation and rendering industry, your website doesn't highlight this aspect. 


Jeremy: That's correct, we haven't placed much emphasis on 3D. 


Tim: Considering the industry growth, we've explored how to integrate it with your current operations. Our preliminary research shows that your competition is quite strong, but your quality and reputation are major assets. 


Jeremy: Yes, we strive to maintain a high standard. 


Tim: Being an end-to-end service provider sets you apart, especially since you also offer design services. Your approachability and active social media presence are additional strengths. It's clear you're focused on establishing a strong reputation. 


Jeremy: We try to make a mark with our projects. 


Tim: One common industry challenge is early detection and planning. It's a time-consuming process, but with the post-Covid movement towards digital tools and the government's tax relief, the adoption of these tools is more feasible.


Tim: Jeremy, you asked about the 0.3 increase in project volume within the Fit industry over the last 12 months. The data came from IBISWorld. There's a link at the end of this presentation to our research papers. Some of the data we've collected from our other implementations is also included here.


Our aim is to simplify processes as there's so much friction everywhere. We want to cut down costs. We incorporate four main principles into every system we make to remove barriers, difficulties, training periods, and more. Our goal is to make systems seamless and intuitive, fitting with existing practices, since the industry is resistant to change. Our solutions need to be accessible to people with different computers and technical skills, and end-to-end in line with your practices.


We've implemented the marketing side to showcase our tools, technologies, and abilities. Now, I'll discuss key aspects relevant to you. How much of your business comes from referrals, repeat clients, or positive testimonials?


Jeremy: A good amount of our business comes from these sources, and we're pushing for more. We're doing a lot of work around testimonials on Google and Google Star ratings for our individual Google My Business pages. Currently, we're focused on building our brand and image, emphasizing our expertise.


Tim: That's good. We ensure the provider's brand is prominent in our interface, and all our tours are easy to share. We've made our tools easily accessible and fun to use. They're web-based and made to be shown off with your brand upfront. They can be plugged into all your social media platforms. We build all our solutions with the philosophy of making it easy for people to find information, addressing the core issue of people not being able to present or find information, which often leads to time wasted searching.


Jeremy: One common issue in design is miscommunication. Customers often think they're receiving one product based on a design they've seen on paper. Then when they see the final product, they're confused about the design elements, like tiles, that were explicitly in the plans.


Tim: Yes, customers often struggle to read and understand plans. They underestimate the power of visual spatial memory, which is sometimes more effective than comprehensive memory. Our work leverages this visual spatial understanding to help customers easily navigate and automate processes. This way, they can avoid misunderstanding design plans. 


We also provide information hotspots as points of interest. Users can click on these to access more information. This information can come in various forms, such as images, PDFs, videos, websites, documents, or even surveys. 


We are in the late beta stage of implementing a markup tool. This tool helps those who struggle with reading plans. Users can draw annotations directly onto the plan. The system then stores these annotations with information about who made them and when. Users can even start an instant chat about a particular annotation. 


This system is part of our Property Wizard tool, which can do much more than what I've described. For instance, it can generate high-quality renders for social media, help with pre-leasing and pre-sales, and offer different viewing modes, such as day or night. 


In the future, we'll be forming strategic partnerships with different sectors and conducting seminars through various industry bodies. A critical part of our tool is the data behind it, which helps us understand the industry, its operations, competitors, software, and challenges. We use this understanding to develop detailed proposals for improvements. 


This conversation is a basic initial discussion about our tool, and the proposal will contain more specifics.


Tim: To simplify the process, here's an initial outline based on our brief discussion. After the second revision round, the client gets a virtual tour and a week to provide feedback. They can communicate internally, collect opinions, and return with a detailed revision. This leads to the final version, which they can use for marketing and potentially on-site construction. Tradespeople unfamiliar with reading plans can scan a QR code for a clear visual reference.


Our approach aligns with many of your challenges. Our primary objective is to make things easier for end clients, as people value ease. This reduces issues with miscommunication and unexpected variations, improving accountability. It also supports consistency, crucial for branding and image. 


Our property wizard integrates with all file types, so there's no need for significant changes. Your team continues to model plans in your design software, like SketchUp, Acad, or Revit. They just upload these models to our server for us to work with. 


Jeremy: So, are your team or ours handling the rendering aspect of the finished product? 


Jeremy: We're considering a standard fitout for Red's group's 300 square meter space. Given the detail we've seen at Lindsay's place, I'm guessing your design process would take about a week?


Tim: Ideally, we'd aim for completion within a week, and if possible, within three days. This will involve both our own development and mild cooperation from the franchise. It's important to not set a rigid deadline for the first few times, presenting it as a trial run. We can assure them of completion within three weeks and request their feedback. As we progress, we can delve into the business objectives and details to configure a system accordingly.


Jeremy: From our perspective, we see design as a crucial aspect of our business. We're already in talks with one of our franchise partners about setting up an in-house design company. This would cater to our corporate clients and new franchise partners who might not have their own designers. Ultimately, we envision a design shop of our own.


Tim: Are you considering remote design?


Jeremy: Initially, it would be based in Adelaide, with plans to expand across the country. Some tasks might be outsourced, particularly visualization aspects. We'll discuss this internally and possibly present it to Sayre, a local franchise, who already employs four or five designers.


Tim: These designers could be instrumental in implementing remote design across the country using the markup tool. It would be a good initial step.


Jeremy: Yes, that sounds feasible. Their design projects range between 500k and 1.5 million, with significant design fees involved. We foresee a lot of our design work transitioning to this model, helping us be market leaders.


Jeremy: Can they design from Adelaide but deal with the client here?
Tim: Yes, they could take the client through a VR journey over Zoom or similar platforms. The client should know how to use it if all the necessary information is curated by the designer. They can do the annotation. 


Jeremy: Take us on a journey.
Tim: In the initial stages, the intent is around flow, movement, space, logistics, which are all basic. The colors are muted, but the lighting is accurate according to the amount of natural light. We can add in accurate lighting according to lighting plans as an extra. 


Depending on your franchises' consistency, many designers provide up to three initial concept options to their clients. We can build that in if that's how they work. You can go through the different options. The next stage could be once they've chosen all their finishes and fixtures. The level of accuracy depends on your preference. We can provide a real-life example or a guide. 


Jeremy: Internet connection is a frustrating incident.
Tim: Indeed, my internet at West End is terrible. But let's focus on the markup tool and the communication side. 


Assume you are a client who has gone through a tour and noticed a wall that you don't like. You can use the tool to communicate that. 


Jeremy: It's a short arrangement.
Tim: I'll have to remember my password, but once in, if you see something you don't like, you can show it to your designer. It's still in late beta, but you can draw, point, add text, and adjust images. You can also crop and resize for social media.


Steve: Can we make a notation during the VR walkthrough?


Tim: Not in VR, it's limited to engagement like walkthroughs. We're working on expanding it for interaction, such as switching styles and products.


Steve: Can the designer switch things in real time during the client's VR experience?


Tim: Yes, that's a feature we're developing. Essentially, multiple people could be in the VR at once. The designer could be adjusting aspects while the client is navigating through the space.


Jeremy: So the designer can make changes while someone else is in VR mode, and the person exploring can use a simple device or their computer to navigate?


Tim: Exactly, we're designing it so the designer can control it while the person explores. They can use affordable VR equipment or just their computer. We're planning on making the interface more visually appealing, and it will include features like creating categories, user permissions, and tagging.


Jeremy: Sounds good. Can we see some VR now?


Tim: Absolutely. For our current project, we're targeting first home buyers with an online order integration. The VR experience includes floating, spinning balls for navigation.


Jeremy: How does the navigation work?


Tim: You'll see several floating balls. You just need to focus on one of them, and you'll move in that direction. We're planning to build out a VR user interface for exploring different concepts and accessing information within the space. Do you think your clients would find this useful?


Jeremy: Our average design fee is around eight to ten thousand dollars. In a price-driven market like luxury homes, it's rare for clients to be willing to pay more. For a million-dollar job, we charge around 2% in fees. Architects might charge three to 5%, depending on the work. Are you suggesting your service would add three to 5% on top of our design fee?


Tim: It depends on how it's invoiced. It needs to be framed correctly. Regardless of how it's marketed, we're looking at roughly a 5% cost.


Steve: So, are we talking about a 5% project value?


Tim: Possibly, the aim of the research and data collection is to figure that out. In new markets, the initial response is often that it's too expensive, especially if people don't understand it. Framing it in the right way is crucial. For example, in residential architecture, we offer a concept tour as an inclusion to add value. This costs about a thousand dollars, and it demonstrates what we can do.


Jeremy: I think the best approach would be to incorporate it into our existing fees. For example, on a project where we're charging eight to ten grand, we could now charge nine to eleven grand and include a basic 3D walkthrough. This is particularly useful for restaurants and medical facilities, where flow is crucial. For larger projects, we could offer a more detailed version for an additional fee.


Tim: Yes, having a base model is important. It helps overcome the resistance people have to new things they're unfamiliar with. We have a lot of data to support its usefulness.


Jeremy: It would be good for us to try it out and see where we can sell it to our franchise partners. We could ask them what they think it's worth. I believe we would need to charge based on services and square meters rather than a percentage.


Tim: It's difficult to turn it into a square meterage unit. The effort required doesn't always correlate with the size of the project.


Steve: We need a project cost structure that our team can sell. It has to be simple, outlining what the client gets for their money. We don't work on a percentage basis when we talk design with our clients, unlike many architects. 


Jeremy: Our approach is more straightforward. We determine the scope based on client type, project size, and required services. For instance, if it's a hospitality project, we consider the size - 200 square meters, 500 square meters, a thousand square meters, and so on. We then allocate a certain number of hours for the project. 


We also consider the level of detail needed - do they want just concept drawings or something more comprehensive? We then estimate how long each task will take based on the project's size. 


Tim: So, it's cost-based pricing worked out in the initial phase. You then provide a full design proposal. 


Jeremy: Exactly. We could include an option like this in our proposal. For instance, a base level for a thousand dollars or a full tour for an extra $5000, which the client could use on their social media. 


Tim: We could provide pricing estimators to fit into your process. 


Jeremy: That could work. We could discuss this with one of our design teams like the one in Adelaide to understand how they could integrate it. 


Tim: That sounds like a plan. 


Jeremy: Our next step should be to explore this further. We have Brady visiting us next week. We could discuss with him how this tool could help win more business. Depending on his interest, we could put you in contact. 


Tim: A product video for the end client could add a lot of value. It would make it easier for them to understand exactly what they're getting.


Jeremy: Absolutely. The video could showcase the services and the benefits of each tier. 


Steve: And if we can sell this to people like Freddy and Z, they can then sell it further.


Jeremy: We close 80% of jobs we design versus 30% we don't design. It's a significant opportunity for us. 


Tim: We've developed substantial resources for large-scale residential systems, for both the private and public sectors. This includes development pre-sales. We could make a short, impactful video showcasing all the key strengths. This feature would set us apart from other proposals they're reviewing. We could consider some form of exclusivity if we knew who your key competitors are. 


Jeremy: Our team will review this and explore its key offerings. We need to understand what this could do for our team. We'll discuss it with Brady and some other members next week to gauge if they see value in it. If they express interest, we'll connect them directly with you for a more detailed presentation. Brett and our in-house designers would be beneficial to include in these discussions. 


Steve: That makes sense, as this is a core part of his business. 


Tim: Speaking with both would be excellent due to the diverse perspectives. 


Jeremy: We'll schedule that for next week and update you towards the end of the week on our progress.
