Other Information about opd and the proposal 7th of may 2023:


OPD Conversation


1.  Contact : Met with Tim from Concert V, who has been briefed about our operations by Bill and Tolleson.


2.  Current Practice : We usually provide a fitout plan and showcase our previous projects to gain customer confidence, especially those interested in purchasing an entire building. 


3.  Proposed Change : Considering offering a detailed visual walkthrough tailor-made to the customer's requirements for larger clients. This is a time-consuming process and not offered to all customers. Plan is to send the walkthrough ideally by the next meeting.


4.  Tim's Suggestion : Provide a less detailed model initially, along with a floor plan and reference images. Client gets time to provide feedback, and we update the model with their revisions. This approach aims at maintaining momentum.


5.  Concerns : The VT representation, though beneficial, is secondary to factors like building location, size, understanding of our services, and funding. If the detailed VT process is time-consuming, it might be considered after securing the deal. 


6.  Building 14 : We've met with the customer three times, and they're interested. Trying to get them to sign the contract and pay the deposit. Might use the VT as a selling point. Need a VT example with a four-day turnaround for stage one and potential evolution for stage two.


7.  Tim's Response : Four-day turnaround might be tight due to the work involved. They have a six-year-old software that allows them to create custom product lines for different sub-markets. They propose to research how to integrate seamlessly with our operations. The initial system development can be reused for building 11. 


8.  Task : Assess the feasibility of implementing the VT system within our existing process, considering the time constraint and cost-benefit analysis. Keep an eye on the progress with building 14 and consider the VT tool as a potential selling point.




1.  Prioritization : Jim needs to decide about building 14 before moving forward with other projects. Tim suggests prioritizing this project if Jim commits to using the system across all projects.


2.  Proposal Needed : Jim requests a specific proposal detailing what Tim can provide, the duration, and cost. Jim has seen a previous proposal for building 11, but it was not specific to this fitout and timeline.


3.  Job Scope : Tim emphasizes the need to define the job's scope, considering its complexity and potential future use. The proposal might involve more than just a few lines due to its intricacy. 


4.  Client Requirements : Jim mentions their selling point is property and their customers usually visit their park. The virtual representation may help attract customers initially, but physical site visits often surpass the impact of any virtual presentation.


5.  Product Integration : Tim suggests integrating their product into existing practices, enhancing the information memorandum with visual cues like QR codes or clickable buttons.


6.  Timeline and Scope : Tim understands Jim's timeline and the perceived value of this tool. Still, the scope remains unclear. Once the system is set up, it can perform various tasks, including updating plans within a week. 


7.  Collaboration Needed : Tim will need to liaise with Anton, who handles cabinetry and finish specifications, to compile the necessary documentation. Tim requests an introductory email to Anton to request the required files.


8.  Estimated Cost : For the proposal's first draft, Tim will incorporate most of what they discussed today, adding a rush fee to the initial part. The estimate given is around $15,000 to $20,000. 


9.  Next Steps : Jim requests detailed information on what they would get for the estimated amount. Tim agrees to send this information in an email the following day. 


This information should assist in proposal preparation, taking into account the importance of defining the project's scope, understanding the client's requirements, and considering the potential future uses of the proposed tool.

 Product to be Delivered 


1.  Initial VT Model (Due within 4-5 business days): 
     Tim from Concert V will provide a less detailed model, with a pleasant but sketchy feel.
     This model will be accompanied by a floor plan and reference images.
     It can be used as a selling point for the building 14 deal.
     The cost for this initial model is estimated to be within the range of $15,000 to $20,000, which will include a rush fee.
     Tim will send an email with detailed information about what this amount will cover.


2.  Updated VT Model (Timeline TBD): 
     Based on the client's feedback on the initial model, a more detailed VT model will be created.
     This model will integrate seamlessly with Jim's operations, potentially being used for building 11 and beyond.
     Specifics for this model will be finalized once the version four of the plan is ready.


 Requirements for Product Delivery 


1.  Initial VT Model: 
     Scope Definition: Tim and Jim need to define the scope of the job for the fitout of building 14.
     Introduction to Anton: Jim to provide an introductory email to Anton, who handles cabinetry and finish specifications.
     Necessary Files: Tim will request necessary files from Anton after the introduction.
   
2.  Updated VT Model: 
     Client's Feedback: The client's feedback on the initial model is crucial to update the VT model.
     Builder and Architect Documentation: Documentation from the builder and architect is needed.
     Landscaping Information: The existing site survey will be used for landscaping, and it's anticipated that previous interior plant designs will be replicated.
