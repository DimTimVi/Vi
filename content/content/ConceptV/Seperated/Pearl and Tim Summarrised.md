Conversation between Pearl (advisor) and Tim (CEO of ConceptV) 4 April 23:


Tim: The raise is now up to about 1.5 million. We've got three industry investors, one in luxury sales space, one of the largest architects in Australia, and we've just started the initial process for the commercial fit outs company. We're trying to make strategic partnerships and have initiatives moving in a few different areas.


Tim: We recently got a director from the Australian Institute of Architects on board, and we're presenting through AIA and other major industry bodies to their audience in about two months. Our major challenge is internal resources and being chronically understaffed.


Tim: We have many revenue opportunities, but cash flow is a struggle. In terms of the pitch, I would follow a similar structure to the 12-pager, introducing the product first, then moving into what we're doing with it, the different products in different markets, relationships, and the problem.


Pearl: You mentioned you have three strategic investors and are looking to raise 1.5 million. Is that correct?


Tim: Yes, 750k is through the industry investors.


Tim: Only 250k is committed, and the other two are in the later stages of discussion. We're thinking about getting another 750k from angel or VC-type investors.


Pearl: Have you discussed valuation and terms of the deal with the strategic investors?


Tim: Yes, 4 million held in a convertible note until the full raise is closed.


Pearl: So it's 4 million pre-money at 250k?


Tim: Yes, the commitment is all good with the 4 million pre.


Pearl: I think the valuation is broadly reasonable. In terms of the pitch deck and raising strategy, there are pros and cons to sending a one-pager or the whole pitch deck first. The most common approach is to send the whole pitch deck.


Tim: The slide indicates that we expect to convert to a mostly SaaS-based system in four to five years. Currently, we have subscription clients who pay for virtual tours for different homes or kits on their website.


Pearl: What does it mean to have subscription clients?


Tim: They have our tools on their website and pay a subscription to keep them live. As for the key user of the platform, there are different ones depending on the sector. In commercial fit-outs, it's the fit-out company; in architecture, it's the architect; and in the volume builder space, it's someone else.


Pearl: If I'm an architect and want to use Concept B, what's the process of getting my plan into a virtual tour on the platform?


Tim: They send us a request for a product type, and upload their files. We currently turn those plans into 3D models, but we're continuing automation until it's completely automated.


Pearl: Your vision for the SaaS is that architects can upload their plans, and they immediately get turned into a 3D tour?


Tim: Yes.


Pearl: A SaaS model is more attractive to tech VCs than a consulting or service-based model. Emphasizing your vision on the SaaS side will help. However, if the SaaS product will only come around in four to five years, it might be a tough sell for investors, as you'll probably require more investment to continue the company's growth and reach that product.


Tim: We've already built version one of our system, which we're using to create repeat projects instead of one-off sales. We make partnerships with people in the industry and charge a fixed percentage of their revenue. We're developing product systems for different services with partners, then templating and packaging that to sell to everyone else. It's all about setting up repeat business.


Tim: We're continuously developing our system, which has an 86% gross profit per project. Our capacity to output projects is significantly higher now and we're not hitting the capacity. We expect to be profitable by June. There are many strategies planned for the next couple of years.


Pearl: When you mention an 86% gross profit margin, what are the components of the cost of goods sold (COGS)?


Tim: The system we made breaks everything down into basic components, like Lego bricks. Each project involves assembling these Lego bricks, which currently requires human labor. COGS consists of the labor required to put these pieces together and the cost of rendering, which is about $18 per tour, as well as subscriptions and software.


Pearl: I think it's important to emphasize that point, as many investors might assume a services-based business would have much lower margins due to labor costs.


Tim: We built a property wizard that allows us to do it with very little labor. Is that a good way to showcase that there isn't much labor involved?


Pearl: Yes, and one way to frame the story is that you've built the property wizard, automating most of the process and requiring minimal human input, resulting in high gross profit margins. You're now working to remove any human input and fully automate the process, ultimately creating a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product for clients that requires no touch on your end.


Tim: Focusing on what we've built right now and why it's great in our current model, while outlining the future potential without going into too much detail, sounds like a good approach.


Pearl: The risk with your current deck is that people might think you're a consulting project-based business with a main product focused on service rather than technology. However, it sounds like you're actually a software business that's built a tech product currently requiring some human input, and you need investment to fully automate it into a SaaS product.


Pearl: The software product offers great scalability since it's not reliant on a services aspect.


Tim: Even before it's a fully automated system, it can be scaled, franchised, and spread all over the world. The property wizard can be completely outsourced easily. Is that worth mentioning?


Pearl: Let me think about it. If your key focus is building it into a SaaS product, highlighting that might be more attractive to investors. Emphasizing a franchising growth or overseas expansion piece could make it seem like the SaaS model isn't your top priority.


Tim: That makes sense, thank you. I'm going to be in Sydney next week. Is there a chance we could catch up for a coffee or drink?


Pearl: Absolutely, I'm based around the city. Let me know when you're available, and we can schedule a time.


Tim: I'll send you an email to schedule. Also, any advice on crafting our story for investors?


Pearl: One of my peers released a helpful article today on how to craft a story for founders and what VC investors look for. I'll share it with you – it's a great step-by-step guide.


Tim: That would be fantastic. My chief priority is telling the right story in a whole different space.


Pearl: No problem. We can also discuss introductions to other investors and warm introductions when we meet. Are you going to be in Sydney often over the next year?


Tim: Most likely, and I can be.


Pearl: There are startup events with founders and investors that you could attend. One quarterly event focuses on early-stage startups and has many angel investors and early-stage VCs. Attending these events can help you network and have valuable conversations with potential investors.


Tim: I'm thinking about events, but the challenge at the moment is time.


Pearl: One thing to bring out more in your deck is that you're about to be profitable in June but you're raising money. It's a strong position since many startups raise money because they're out of cash, but you're raising money to capitalize on opportunities to grow. I think that's important to mention in the deck.


Tim: How can I go about doing that? Would I make a specific point about it or would I lace it into different parts?


Pearl: I would put it on the funding page, slide 13 in your deck, where you talk about your raise.


Tim: So, talk about where we are in terms of being fine with slow growth if we don't get funding, but we're raising money to push up because we have identified opportunities.


Pearl: Yes, exactly. You could say you're about to be break-even in June, but you want to raise money to supercharge your growth on identified opportunities.


Tim: Should that be text, some kind of graphic, or a quote?


Pearl: I think I'd have it as text.


Tim: Let's find a time to sit down and catch up next week when you're in Sydney.


Pearl: Great, nice to chat and I'm excited to finally meet you in person next week. Take care and have a good rest of your day.


Tim: You too, thanks.
