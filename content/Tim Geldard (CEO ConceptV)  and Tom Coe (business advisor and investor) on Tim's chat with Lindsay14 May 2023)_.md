Tim Geldard (CEO ConceptV)  and Tom Coe (business advisor and investor) on Tim's chat with Lindsay14 May 2023):


Tim: I plan to start with friendly chit-chat, followed by exciting news about a major breakthrough at work. I'll then discuss the rapid progress we've made over the last three months and present some material. I'll also mention that we're seeking bridging financing.


Tom: It's good to start with friendly introductions, but keep it brief. Lucy would want to know what's happening with your company. Share the good news first, show growth and opportunities in the pipeline. Acknowledge the current market risks and discuss how you're experiencing positive uptake due to being a cost-saving tool.


Tim: So, the idea is to outline the challenges as well.


Tom: Yes, mention the AI improvement which may reduce the need for more people, but in the medium term, we still need to hire to keep up with growth. So, tell the good news, acknowledge the risks, and discuss mitigation strategies. Then explain why you need finance now.


Tim: Right. I'll discuss all the exciting things, challenges, mitigation strategies, and then delve into the current threats. As our cash flow is lumpy, we need to scale to avoid shortfalls.


Tom: Correct, scaling would help with cash flow regularity. The goal is to convince Lucy that it's a safe loan for a crucial time period, which will be extremely valuable to the company. 


Tim: Exactly, and two months from now, we'll likely have several things come off, leading to revenue. Plus, we've potentially had a breakthrough that could revolutionize the way this company scales. I won't go into too much detail, but it's a significant development.


Tom: The key points are good news, acknowledging the risks ahead, explaining why we need financing now, and then making the request. 


Tim: We're currently in a cash flow situation, which is reasonable given the context. It's important to portray us as good risk managers, acknowledging challenges and positioning ourselves to scale for diversified cash flows that align with the market. 


Tom: That's the narrative an investor would likely buy into. One of their immediate concerns might be what's to prevent you from needing additional funds in two months. They don't want to sink deeper, they'd rather weather the storm and see what remains.


Tim: It would be a shame not to succeed because we have the right story. It's just a matter of delivering it correctly.


Tom: Even if it leads to a situation where you have to let staff go for a while. Remember, the primary goal is to keep the company running. If the company goes under, there won't be any jobs left.


Tim: I've informed everyone about our current position. It wasn't easy. I was in a bad place before, but I've done a lot of reflection and have been working on good strategies. I've returned to a more objective mindset, acknowledging all the positives and realizing that being in this situation is not a mark on my ability.


Tom: You're in the valley of death, which is part of the business cycle. You're in the hardest part. 


Tim: It's almost the most exciting part. I'm so ready and eager.


Tom: Good luck with it. I'd be keen to help build this with you.
