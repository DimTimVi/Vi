# Notes to self on Lindsay Loan

﻿Notes to self on Lindsay (current investor who Tim is requisition money) on Bridging Finance (9th may 2023):


Post-quoting, assign Liam to introduce the Swapper system and prepare the nucleus for operation. Request Jordy's update on script completion. Instruct Jay to categorize furniture and furniture types relevant to architecture, design, and development industries, and compile briefs for different categories in order to outsource collection. Document the preparation process for furniture and material assets for the nuclear server. 


Direct Michael to draft a list of key automations for the skin and tour, and establish an upload setup for adjustments. Also, task Michael to include a cache-clearing refresh button at the top left of every tour. 


Commission Liam to explore deep search implementation for firm creation and draft a proposal. Instruct Jackie to compile the Angela quote. Assign Liam to resume the Omniverse development partner initiative and work on overlay custom code. 


Finally, create new, simplified slides for the architect templates, ensuring each slide is interactive to provide additional information. Arrange the information comprehensively in the short version.


In a conversation with Lindsay, begin by saying, "Lindsay, I'm onto something big here. I have well-thought-out plans." Make it clear that you're not just asking for money, but also want to share your vision because you believe it will make Lindsay proud. 


Be enthusiastic and share a brief background on the history, including the chart you described in an earlier entry. Begin the conversation on an excited note, "I really wanted to do this in person. When you're back, we've got to find time for lunch."


Proceed to explain your current status. "We've spent six years developing the Property Wizard, forming networks, connections, and conducting market research. Last June, we initiated a soft launch to test our system and gauge interest for our products, compressing our initial 18-month plan."


Highlight the positive feedback received from cold calls and industry network expansion, which prompted you to expedite the timeline by 12 months.


Over the past six months, you've been preparing for a capital raise - collecting case studies, testimonials, creating opportunities, growing clients, increasing revenue, making the right connections, finding industry partners and support.


You've been preparing for your capital raise, developing both your networks and skills, providing evidence of traction, refining your pitch deck, and setting up warm introductions. As a result, you've managed to raise $1.5 million through venture capital and three industry partners.


You're in late-stage conversations with two significant industry partners and are actively servicing two markets. Additionally, you have three significant potential industry investors in three other markets, one of which has already committed.


The conversation may also cover additional topics from earlier notes.


Note to self when discussing. Scratch that. When talking to Lindsay, you can preempt it by saying, look, Lindsay, where aren't into something big here. And that can come right after you've said, but before you consider. Let me explain the situation. 
I 
You can say, look, Lindsay, I'm onto something big here. 
I have well thought out, 
Recent 
Researched, scratch that. I have well thought out plans. 
Yeah, just that first bit. I'm onto something big here. 
Nothing, Mike. 
All right, now we right now ain't cash flow fucked. 
You can say something like, now I am asking you for money, but I am scratch that. 
But I want to telling more because I think you'll be proud in brackets. 
Add this as a footnote to this entry, G P T four. 
Lindsay will like this. It feels like a son, father thing. He likes that kind of advisory stuff. Close brackets being enthusiastic and happy about it. Give that brief background on the history, the chart that you showed earlier on. 
Scratch that the chart that you described in an earlier entry tree. Open brackets. Add this, scratch that. G P T four, add the following as a footnote in your reply search for references to previous entry to combine info, close brackets. 
Start out all excited, be smiley and goofy and start the whole conversation by saying, I really wanted to do this in person. So when we scratch that, so when you are back, we've gotta find time for lunch. 
Now to give you a brief catch up 
To where we are right now, show the chart. 
We spent six years developing the property wizard and forming networks and connections and market research. Market testing, market testing. 
Six months ago, scratch that. In June last year, we started our soft launch to test our system and to test appetite for one of our product, for one of our products, for some of our products rather than the planned 18 months. 
Oh, of further integration, uh, open brackets. You can summarize this bit. I guess scratch that close bracket plan for 18 months to do all this kind of stuff. 
But the response that you've got in both your cold call uptake and, I don't know, success in industry or network expansion or something like that. 
You brought your timeline forward 12 months, uh, right now. 
Scratch that in order to, I don't know, expedite our system them. 
Now we've done that and to do this, we needed to raise capital over six months. Over the last six months, I have been pre preparing for my capital raise, collecting case studies, collecting testimonials, creating opportunities, growing clients, creating revenue, making the right connections, finding industry partners, finding industry association and industry support, 
And grooming yourself for your capital raise both in networks and skills and evidence, traction, developing your traction and your investor network and your pitch and pitch deck and getting warm introductions and developing warm introductions and setting up warm introductions 
Through 
Which you will have raised one and a half million dollars. 
Three venture capital and three industry partners. 
We've been in late stage conversations with two significant industry partners, strategic industry partners in scratch that you have industry partnerships and they're actively servicing two markets at present. 
You have three significant potential industry investors in three other markets. 
One which has already committed, one of which has committed all of whom are well connected or whatever. 
Then maybe something about other stuff from earlier notes.

# Notes to self on strategy and perspective and ideas

2023 [Title] [GPT this section is thoughts and strategy about ConceptV and what I need to do - Tim Geldard]
Get as many of the big guys as possible, raise more many. You can show the resources that went into getting them, lead time and support growth. 

You’re going to increase our revenue with a very very good Business Development management. You’re going to hire 7 specific people to demolish cogs exponentially by building the Property Wizard. You’re going to increase your capacity by refining outsourcing ability and asset library. 

We’re going to build demand in the market by selling the Virtual Tours, and we’ve shown the COA and lead teams on acquisition. We’re going to the build the system behind the product where our customers can simply build VTs themselves, and convert to a SaaS. 

You have found the exact people who are needed to deliver this, and all of them are keen and ready to start this month. 

This is what investors need to see. 

Put Jackie with the sales person. Those two become a 2 person team. 

Write up on position of the company, market, state of things etc for sales person. Give them all the information, and set KPI’s. financially motivate them with milestones. Get them to work with Jackie to come up with a way to do it. 

Work out how much of their investment + your expense will be claimed back as R&D. Show how I can claim back money spent delivering projects. Thus shows smart and effective use of funds. 

In your use of funds slide, show the actual people that will be added to The Team with their funds. Under each person, have a milestone track, showing what they will bring to the business. Like revenue generation for sales, and cost reduction or supply variability or % automated or something. 

Get Michael to make a Splashscreen that gives the user the ability to find all the materials about us. Different tour products, different documents etc. 

Make 20-30 sec video explaining what a Virtual Tour is, and where it can be used. Hire a videographer for this, ask Nick Christy if he knows anyone. 

Get all programmers to adopt as much AI writing code as possible. Everyone needs to look at what we’re doing from an AI perspective. 

Bring Jackie to pitches. She could ntrols slides

“We’re entering the market by building the product FOR them. In the future, the Property Wizard will let the clients build it themselves”

Get Jackie to find pricing on MetaLuxe. Show how much cheaper our build cost is than theirs. 

Explain you have more info if asked. Thing that has changed is I’m prepared, and closed $x sales in last month. Explain what we made, the property wizard, the revenue model and future plan. We’re entering residential sales market, market conditions indicate greater need over next 12 months, and two competitors have entered the market with success. In competition, say we have more information, but are focusing on Lucid Vue and MetaLuxe. Show how and why ours is way better. 

Market movements indicate an increasing demand over the next 12 months, and we plan to use that scale our business. 

Market rates are being set by lucid vue and MetaLuxe. We’re we to charge what they our, our gross profit would be 94%. 

Our Cirtual Tours are cheaper,better, faster and have enormous potential to break more markets. 

We’ve established a cheap and effective go to market strategy over the last few months. Direct contact, complimentary tour, sale. COA is $X for a contract worth $x annually on average. 

Get Jordie and Jackie to get me data on COA and costs etc. get graphs and everything so investors can check it out. 

Build a wizard for contractors that walks them through a demo project and then guides them through the process of their task. 

If we’re creating a wizard for how to make exactly what we need, we open ourselves up to reverse engineering. We can manually encrypt it by getting to put the work together in a confusing way, and we have scripts that change a bunch of the controls files according to a code we’ve made. 

Get Jackie to find the people on the board for target VC companies, and see if I know someone that knows them. Also get Pearl to find those VCs. 

iPhones have the ability to mix LiDAR and photogrammetry. Use a drone and a phone to scan an area. Use AI to read the images, and identify what is what. Based on that, apply rules to generate clean geometry with texture UVs.

To convince Grant: who knows, they might not accept. Either way you win. You’ve seen my one pager. You know what we’re building, and you can already see what it can do now. This is going to be history, don’t you want to be part of something? When Damian invests, you two will both be working on it. Won’t that be cool? 

A potential alternate SaaS: offer your services through design and construct, and build exact replicas of everyone’s documentation. As the Property Wizard improves, you’ll be able to run a fully accurate virtual tour that users can identify the problems with. Build the Property Wizard to something that ArchViz people can pilot it. Then sell su script ions to the ArchViz people.

Use our future AI plans, that doesn’t exist, that no one else can fry it because we make it. VC get hard on. 

If you haven’t got big developers for the pitch, show the demand by using direct competition. 

I’m pitch, when outlining competition, focus on the rigid structure, they can’t adapt with the current volition market. High density luxury residential is big right now because of market movements 24 months. Over the last 12 months, x big builders have gone under. That has reduced capacity by y. As a result, the industry must move away from large developments, little over 6 stories over the coming 12 months. Our direct competitors are Australia based, and their key industry is high density - it’s the only industry where the high cost doesn’t matter too much. Their demand and revenue will dry up. That’s why we’ve been moving into the architectural space. That’s why we’re developing name there, and building passive revenue. Direct competitors are likely wanting to target smaller builds, but their high cost will likely make it difficult. Our cost base is already at 10% of theirs, and with planned development over the next 6 months that is set to drop below 5% - opening up a plethora of markets they cannot access. 

We’re entering the market now. Timing is incredibly important for this. 

When talking about competition, explain how important it is to be nimble - we’re in u chartered territory and the whole industry is constantly changing between extremes. Lucid and Metaluxe are not nimble, and their focus market is their only market. The recent closure of x biggest builders is going to dramatically minimise the amount of high density developments over the next 12 months. This has happened before with different competitors in different markets. Situ systems couldn’t move, cut half their staff and I poached one of their best software engineers. 

Find competitors that have folded over the last two years. 

Next likely big push is in master planned communities, architecture in 12 months. Land developments would have kicked hard after the shortage. Find data. 

You MUST bring more AI into your pitch. These new multi-modal AIs (GPT 4) open up an entirely new way for people to interact with property. Image recognition and language models, combined with our system, can enable extreme efficiency. The Markup Tool, powered by GPT 4 and connected with the Property Wizard, can allow the design coordination of a project to do a process that would take 6 months in a single day. AI that lets people interface with the Virtual Tours enables the Property Wizard to do SO MUCH MORE. 

Find an AI person now. 

Add in the AI wave at the moment to the timing part of pitch? 

For Grant, get him to out in 250k as convertible note with floor clause. Raising more later, will have a higher val. For Damian: we will focus on developing good relationships with suppliers and architects. In 4-6 months, three of us get dinner. He’s a smart guy you said. He will understand what we’re building, and he will invest. 

For Tamara, to get her really pushing: give conditional offer, something to do with performance? Explain options. Explain exactly what it is that you’re building, and what your plans for it are. Building a billion dollar company. 

With Grant money, make him your sales person. Maybe grant additional shares for extra sales in x period. Or, commissions. Get him to setup meetings with developers who aren’t his clients. With Tamara, get all the info from her from her last product library plan, design the system and user interface and get that started. Make first Lean In about educating around supplier specification and say you’re doing research and getting and end client wants (better tech). Offer a free Tour and design tour discounts for people that respond to the survey and agree to interview. Part of survey is a couple of shots of their chosen plan, and a bit of info about it. Then get suppliers on board and build first version of system. Make connection with that researcher. Second lean in like a month or so later, discussing the results of the survey, and the product library you’re making. Do more free tours for first users. 

With grants money, get the AI team going so we can automate creation of supplier materials. Make user portal to standardise supplier onboarding and automate. Do for railclone too. Get Shane working on most common problems with architects. Get lost from Liam on what takes most time, standardise Architect upload. Get mock-ups from Jackie to show system for suppliers. Build plug-in for design software that connects with product library. Maybe use the product library stuff as a way of forcing designers to configure their model on a particular way, a way that makes it faster for us to do a Tour. 

For for all brain trust to do an AI course. Get Louie help to choose which one. 

Trademark Digital Tours

Push Grant and Tamara. 

Add a BDM to pitch. Your theme is time. Opportunity, setup and dev opportunity. You are ready to take on high volume. You have almost no time to dedicate to sales, majority is through using your network, which while large, is still developing. You are limited by your time in BDM role. Opportunity in development market is still there, but with market conditions that’s likely to dry up within 12 months at most. You’ve got a huge capacity and you’re building it more. You have an incredible value proposition that literally no one else can give. The colsest competition is charging an enourmius amount for an inferior product. All those restricted from using their product by price, but who want to, now have the ability to do. 

Explain the bit above

Hire both software developer and data scientist. They both build PW and V at same
Time. 

Spend money on that AI team from Amazon to build V2.0 of Vi. Make sure to get it made so GPT 4 can built swapped in later. For code, pay to be in python with clear documentation. 

For pitch, include rebranding to Vi. 

With direct access to developers pioneering AI models, we’re finally able to integrate AI to our company wide system and change the game. Early prototypes are supporting the thesis of AI compatibility. In fact, a crude system + prototype pair will generate a summary, to do lists along side suggestions and instructions, and delegate resultant work just from this conversation. 

I know I’m not the best financial manager on the world but Lyndsey, the whole world is about to change and it’s going to be quick. We are in the optimal position to not just ride the wave, but be part of making it.  (Refined and punchy version of this would make a great intro, along with something like ‘we (important to include him in your opening statements and everything company relates by saying you and I at the start, and we from then on) are on the verge of making history. I have good reason to believe that we’re a unicorn. We have next generation technology, strong market presence, a never before seen, market tested product, first movers in a massive blue ocean (something to say a replicable product type for like hundreds of adjacent markets), something like ‘a fully standardised delivery process that will service the whole world in less than 5 years.’ Conservative ARR for FY24 are $X even in a down economy. I’m relation to the down economy, you are taking advantage of the fact the economy is down. Why? Because developers at at risk of massive losses, everyone needs presales for debt. Everyone wants our competitors product, but only a select few can afford it. We’re bringing an upgraded offering at a fraction of the cost and are making it really easy/non exclusive for the remaining seperate developers to access it. Besides, our whole package is profitable at the same price as competitors providing renders alone. 

For Tim - other question prompts to come up with 

During initial elevator summary, 

Barrel - oat cappuccino 

You’re and AI proptech company working with developers to get their projects to market on time. too to get developments get to market earlier. 

saving developers time by simplifying/streamlining the design and sale stages. 

I run an AI proptech company. I work with developers to reduce time and money through design and sale. 

Super Human

South African investor - say something about castle lager 

‘Programmer’ - Eric investment NZ

BDM must be in a good network. Get someone expensive who is big in the developer world. 

I’m a brilliant guy with a great thing. Im looking for someone with a good network who will help me clean up the company and scale. 

For Lindsay, you’ve started making significant connections in property development giant owners, Venture Capital, governing industry bodies, technology, architecture in preparation for a mass launch. I’ve got the technology, the team, and the traction to be a unicorn. I need even cashflow to cover pits in revenue, and time for these connections to crystallise. 

Now. For downside protection. We have $250k committed, R&D and $x in revenue. Upside %=

You need to be touring, making connections. Going to these events, networking. You’ve got opportunity to be presenting at these events, yet you’re not taking them. You need to be flying places, expanding your network.   Money is holding you back. 

For Lindsay, you could talk about the side revenue opportunities. Your Vi is already as efficient as 3 people. You studied ML and neural networks when you started this, and the whole system is setup to automate a huge amount of management. We’re advancing, packaging and selling modules of Vi and we develop. 

For Lindsay explain what happened that you need it and why it’s unlikely to happen again. One section on Historic Finance Strategy, Compressed Timeline, Opportunity Lead Time, Resource Limitations: lean bootstrap, lumpy model. Lead time on opportunity, cost increase from shortening timeline. Why the same problem won’t happen again: Revenue in Pipeline, R&D, Industry Investment. What happens if no VC - Action: Extend timeline, reduce scope. Cashflow: R&D, Industry Investor, Revenue. What happens if no Industry Investor - Action: same as above. Cashflow: Revenue. Even low conversion, still x amount runway. No revenue, loan and R&D gets me x months. 

For Lindsay, could outline key sensitivities, the responses to SWOT. Could make a risk matrix after the SWOT. 

Perhaps for Lindsay, but for pitches in general, when talking about AI and Vi, the very fact of its existence as a vanilla, limited version cuts out so many obstacles

# Reflections on people, pitches, business strategy, perspectiove

[Heading] Reflections on people, pitches, business strategy, perspective by Tim Geldard referring to himself (up until May 2023):

The recent closure of x biggest builders is going to dramatically minimise the amount of high density developments over the next 12 months. This has happened before with different competitors in different markets. Situ systems couldn’t move, cut half their staff and I poached one of their best software engineers. 

Find competitors that have folded over the last two years. 

Next likely big push is in master planned communities, architecture in 12 months. Land developments would have kicked hard after the shortage. Find data. 

You MUST bring more AI into your pitch. These new multi-modal AIs (GPT 4) open up an entirely new way for people to interact with property. Image recognition and language models, combined with our system, can enable extreme efficiency. The Markup Tool, powered by GPT 4 and connected with the Property Wizard, can allow the design coordination of a project to do a process that would take 6 months in a single day. AI that lets people interface with the Virtual Tours enables the Property Wizard to do SO MUCH MORE. 

Find an AI person now. 

Add in the AI wave at the moment to the timing part of pitch? 

For Grant, get him to out in 250k as convertible note with floor clause. Raising more later, will have a higher val. For Damian: we will focus on developing good relationships with suppliers and architects. In 4-6 months, three of us get dinner. He’s a smart guy you said. He will understand what we’re building, and he will invest. 

For Tamara, to get her really pushing: give conditional offer, something to do with performance? Explain options. Explain exactly what it is that you’re building, and what your plans for it are. Building a billion dollar company. 

With Grant money, make him your sales person. Maybe grant additional shares for extra sales in x period. Or, commissions. Get him to setup meetings with developers who aren’t his clients. With Tamara, get all the info from her from her last product library plan, design the system and user interface and get that started. Make first Lean In about educating around supplier specification and say you’re doing research and getting and end client wants (better tech). Offer a free Tour and design tour discounts for people that respond to the survey and agree to interview. Part of survey is a couple of shots of their chosen plan, and a bit of info about it. Then get suppliers on board and build first version of system. Make connection with that researcher. Second lean in like a month or so later, discussing the results of the survey, and the product library you’re making. Do more free tours for first users. 

With grants money, get the AI team going so we can automate creation of supplier materials. Make user portal to standardise supplier onboarding and automate. Do for railclone too. Get Shane working on most common problems with architects. Get lost from Liam on what takes most time, standardise Architect upload. Get mock-ups from Jackie to show system for suppliers. Build plug-in for design software that connects with product library. Maybe use the product library stuff as a way of forcing designers to configure their model on a particular way, a way that makes it faster for us to do a Tour. 

For for all brain trust to do an AI course. Get Louie help to choose which one. 

Trademark Digital Tours

Push Grant and Tamara. 

Add a BDM to pitch. Your theme is time. Opportunity, setup and dev opportunity. You are ready to take on high volume. You have almost no time to dedicate to sales, majority is through using your network, which while large, is still developing. You are limited by your time in BDM role. Opportunity in development market is still there, but with market conditions that’s likely to dry up within 12 months at most. You’ve got a huge capacity and you’re building it more. You have an incredible value proposition that literally no one else can give. The colsest competition is charging an enourmius amount for an inferior product. All those restricted from using their product by price, but who want to, now have the ability to do. 

Explain the bit above

Hire both software developer and data scientist. They both build PW and V at same
Time. 

Spend money on that AI team from Amazon to build V2.0 of Vi. Make sure to get it made so GPT 4 can built swapped in later. For code, pay to be in python with clear documentation. 

For pitch, include rebranding to Vi. 

With direct access to developers pioneering AI models, we’re finally able to integrate AI to our company wide system and change the game. Early prototypes are supporting the thesis of AI compatibility. In fact, a crude system + prototype pair will generate a summary, to do lists along side suggestions and instructions, and delegate resultant work just from this conversation. 

I know I’m not the best financial manager on the world but Lyndsey, the whole world is about to change and it’s going to be quick. We are in the optimal position to not just ride the wave, but be part of making it.  (Refined and punchy version of this would make a great intro, along with something like ‘we (important to include him in your opening statements and everything company relates by saying you and I at the start, and we from then on) are on the verge of making history. I have good reason to believe that we’re a unicorn. We have next generation technology, strong market presence, a never before seen, market tested product, first movers in a massive blue ocean (something to say a replicable product type for like hundreds of adjacent markets), something like ‘a fully standardised delivery process that will service the whole world in less than 5 years.’ Conservative ARR for FY24 are $X even in a down economy. I’m relation to the down economy, you are taking advantage of the fact the economy is down. Why? Because developers at at risk of massive losses, everyone needs presales for debt. Everyone wants our competitors product, but only a select few can afford it. We’re bringing an upgraded offering at a fraction of the cost and are making it really easy/non exclusive for the remaining seperate developers to access it. Besides, our whole package is profitable at the same price as competitors providing renders alone. 

For Tim - other question prompts to come up with 

During initial elevator summary, 

Barrel - oat cappuccino 

You’re and AI proptech company working with developers to get their projects to market on time. too to get developments get to market earlier. 

saving developers time by simplifying/streamlining the design and sale stages. 

I run an AI proptech company. I work with developers to reduce time and money through design and sale. 

Super Human

South African investor - say something about castle lager 

‘Programmer’ - Eric investment NZ

BDM must be in a good network. Get someone expensive who is big in the developer world. 

I’m a brilliant guy with a great thing. Im looking for someone with a good network who will help me clean up the company and scale. 

For Lindsay, you’ve started making significant connections in property development giant owners, Venture Capital, governing industry bodies, technology, architecture in preparation for a mass launch. I’ve got the technology, the team, and the traction to be a unicorn. I need even cashflow to cover pits in revenue, and time for these connections to crystallise. 

Now. For downside protection. We have $250k committed, R&D and $x in revenue. Upside %=

You need to be touring, making connections. Going to these events, networking. You’ve got opportunity to be presenting at these events, yet you’re not taking them. You need to be flying places, expanding your network.   Money is holding you back. 

For Lindsay, you could talk about the side revenue opportunities. Your Vi is already as efficient as 3 people. You studied ML and neural networks when you started this, and the whole system is setup to automate a huge amount of management. We’re advancing, packaging and selling modules of Vi and we develop. 

For Lindsay explain what happened that you need it and why it’s unlikely to happen again. One section on Historic Finance Strategy, Compressed Timeline, Opportunity Lead Time, Resource Limitations: lean bootstrap, lumpy model. Lead time on opportunity, cost increase from shortening timeline. Why the same problem won’t happen again: Revenue in Pipeline, R&D, Industry Investment. What happens if no VC - Action: Extend timeline, reduce scope. Cashflow: R&D, Industry Investor, Revenue. What happens if no Industry Investor - Action: same as above. Cashflow: Revenue. Even low conversion, still x amount runway. No revenue, loan and R&D gets me x months. 

For Lindsay, could outline key sensitivities, the responses to SWOT. Could make a risk matrix after the SWOT. 

Perhaps for Lindsay, but for pitches in general, when talking about AI and Vi, the very fact of its existence as a vanilla, limited version cuts out so many obstacles

# Team Meeting Summarised

﻿ConceptV Team Meeting 9/05/2023


Tim: Thank you all for coming. This meeting is critical as we need to discuss the company's status. There are three critical factors to starting a company: timing, the product, and networks. Of these, timing is the most challenging to get right. 


We built the company using the lean startup methodology, bootstrapping it with a total of $200K over six years. Our financing strategy comprised of investment, the research and development tax incentive, and sales. 


In June, we entered the soft launch stage, expecting it to last 12-18 months. However, due to overwhelming interest, we expedited the timeline, necessitating the hiring of additional team members. 


Recently, managing my time has become a challenge, given my numerous responsibilities. This difficulty extends to juggling immediate, medium, and long-term objectives, especially cash flow management. 


We've managed to run the company for six years without missing any payrolls, a rare achievement for startups. However, the next month could be challenging. 


In our three-month pipeline, we anticipate about $160K in revenue from various sources. Despite this, we're experiencing a short-term cash gap. 


Typically, companies have an overdraft facility, but due to our company's stage, securing one is challenging. An initial plan fell through, leaving us in a difficult financial position. 


We have about $100K confirmed through R&D and a $250K commitment, among other potential income sources. Despite the current challenge, we are very close to a significant breakthrough. 


To navigate this situation, we have several strategies. We have numerous outstanding invoices, which, once issued, could generate a minimum of $20K. 


The rest of my week is dedicated to networking meetings with VC people in Sydney and a developer summit. I need your help in organizing all the materials I require. 


Specifically, Liam, I need you to retrieve 3D files from previous emails. Jordy, I need you to review recent emails to ensure we have all the necessary materials.


Liam, I need you to estimate the time required for the project outlined in our emails and the previous proposal. Adjust the proposal based on the new information. 


Jay, assess if you have all the information for the fitouts. Determine what you need and where to get the furniture. Give me an estimate for the required budget and any additional requirements. Liaise with Liam before our 4:30 meeting and have questions ready. 


Next, review all material from Angela, assuming a similar level of modeling quality to the PDF. For Angela's project and the OPD one, consider stage delivery. For OPD, time is critical, so create a layout-quality tour as soon as possible.


Michael, coordinate with Liam and Jackie on your work schedule. For the Angela project, due for the AIA in a month, prepare three different quality levels using a style switcher. Provide estimates for these and ensure invoices are sent out by midday tomorrow.


In terms of additional funding, I'll discuss bridging finance with our initial investors. I have meetings set with Lindsay this weekend and two more early next week. Jackie and I will plan for our conversation with Lindsay. 


We are close to achieving significant breakthroughs. There's Tamara's project, the AIA meeting, potential investment and jobs from Mode Architecture, commercial fitout opportunities, and others. Despite the cash flow issue, I'm confident we'll navigate this situation successfully.


I apologize for letting you down and failing in my responsibilities. If you have any questions, please ask. We're all navigating new territory here.


Jackie: I'll be handling quote files among other tasks.


Tim: Most of the files just require PDF conversion, except for OPD and Angela's, which need full proposals. We'll need to prioritize tasks as this might delay some opportunities. We could potentially push the AIA event back.


Jackie: That's feasible since they have three other events on the same day.


Tim: Excellent. We'll delay it by two weeks. On the VC front, the company's committed value has grown to $4 million from $2.75 million in February. This increase implies that potential investors are willing to invest $250K based on the $4 million valuation. In two months, when we approach VCs, I aim for a $6 million valuation. The progress we've made in three months is incredible. Our development side has made significant strides, particularly in rendering and pipeline system development.


However, time management remains a challenge for me. Consequently, next week's pay might be delayed by up to two weeks. Please bear with the situation and ask any necessary questions. Our communication system needs improvement, which is something we all need to work on. 


I've set up a virtual assistant to automatically convert our meeting into a report and action items, which should enhance our communication. 


In terms of tasks, Luke's invoice needs to be paid, although he could only afford half.


Jackie: Should I have started on the splash screen?


Tim: That was decided last night. Also, Michael, I mentioned a splash screen for the QR code. Jackie's already started on it. I need you to take the mockup with six tours and add the video and one-pager. After that, please work on a landing page as soon as possible. I'm meeting with the network tomorrow, and having the landing page ready would be fantastic.

# Tim and a job Lindsay Pitch

Tim and a job Lindsay Pitch
Tim: Um, I wanted to start off with like friendly stuff, chit chat, just that and whatever. And then I want to go with something that is like really exciting. I'm probably gonna make point of the fact that I'm at work at the moment because we've just had a massive breakthrough with some really cool shit to get him excited.
And then, um, also go into what I've been doing for the last two weeks and like now the last three months has been absolutely wild. The amount of stuff that we've been doing. And then go into, now I've got some stuff to show you. Um, I will give you a, but I'll give you a heads up. I will be like, what? We're seeking bridging financing and that'll be, how should I go about that basically?
But cuz like, I don't want it to just come up halfway through about me being like, Hey, I have some Mike. Because that'll really stay in. Anything else? No, 
Tom: I think, I wanna say, I think, I think like touch on the friendly stuff, like friendly introductions, but not too long. Cause like Lucy's bullshit, right? He wants to get along with it and he would want like to know what's been happening with your company.
Like what? Tell him the good news first. Yeah. Tell him like, you're progressing, you're growing. Have lots of these opportunities in the pipeline. Um, tell him, show him that you like, see the risk. Associated with the current market as well and say how, how, tell the story of how you are having positive uptake because it is a cost saving tool.
Yeah. So I doing their business And go into the way that where, because you need to acknowledge the risks, right? Yeah. And then 
Tim: sort of outline with being tenure manager or whatever. 
Tom: Yeah. We'll talk, you can talk about, I'll weave the AI thing into it as like we may have a significant. Improvement in our efficiency and our costs.
That might mean that we don't need to bring on as many people if we can work through this thing, but that's gonna be a little while In the medium term, we're still gonna need to bring on some more people to keep up with our current growth. Yeah. That's point stagnate and not stagnate. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but like, tell the good news story.
Tell him that you see the risks of the road ahead and tell him that you have like mitigation strategies for them. Okay, so, and then, and maybe, maybe I don't need to need to go through and then explain to him why you need finance right now. You know that. 
Tim: Okay. All right. Yeah, yeah. So I can give the overarching thing, talking about all the different really cool things.
Positive first, 
Tom: positive stuff. And challenges. The challenges, yeah. Acknowledgement of that. 
Tim: Difficulty with the industry and everything like that. Um, and then have a going about and mitigation strategy and. And then go into, um, greater threats at the moment. Um, then around like now, cause we push this stuff up and then the economy, like, you know, our cashflow is lumpy as stock.
Tom: Um, we've got a shortfall. Yeah. So that's why you need a scale. So then you don't have as lumpy cash flow if you have like more significant month penetration. I think, I think the better way 
Tim: to go about this is from the agreement that time. It's a necessary thing. I don't need to convince him that we should go for the raise.
That's an obvious thing. I need to convince him that it's a, a safe loan to, to give me that it is four, six months and what that time will give me like that's, that will be of extreme value to the company. It's two months from now after I've gone through like more things with this current opportunity.
Then I'll very likely be at a stage where any of these different things have come off where we've got 
Tom: this revenue. Yeah. And also you may have a significant improvement in your cost per unit manufactured, if you can do this like turnaround time thing with like GPT four that alters those files 
Tim: directly.
Yeah, I probably won't talk too much about that unless us, I'll probably be like now. I'm not gonna go into it too much, but you can see on my work at the moment, um, over the last two weeks, we have potentially had a breakthrough that could completely revolutionize, um, the way this company can scale and what it can do.
Tom: Yeah. But I think, I think it's the key points to that, you know, good news. Acknowledging the risks in the road ahead, explaining why you need that financing now, and 
Tim: then asking him for it, and then going into, um, now I prepared a short presentation to give you a bit more context around the label end at the moment.
Yep. Um, in order to help make your, your decision or something. So how did actually go about the ask? So it'd being like, right. These, these are the sort of reasons why we're in this cash flow thing. And I, I wanna make that easy to understand because that's a very reasonable thing to, to have happened given all of the contexts.
Yeah. Like this is 
Tom: extremely like Yeah. I think that's why it's so important that he sees you as good risk manager. Yeah. And that's why you go say, I acknowledge the risk in the road and the challenges ahead. This is why we need to position ourselves for that by scaling is if we are more diversified, our cash flows less lovely and we ride with the overall market and we can do that efficiently.
Yeah, cut the narrative that I would be most inclined to buy into. Very true. That's a good 
Tim: one. Especially 
Tom: because, Now that you've mentioned that one of his immediate thoughts as an investor 
Tim: will be, well, what's gonna stop you 
Tom: needing another 50 grand and two? Exactly. Yeah. He doesn't wanna get deeper into our hole.
He wants to wait until the storm has happened and then go see what's left. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's the job. We've given an investor. Very true. I head off, mate, coming in. It's been very, very engaging, but I know you'll, I know, I know you'll crush it. Thanks, 
Tim: man. I, uh, You're real shame if I didn't, cuz I have the right story.
Mm-hmm. It's just delivering it 
Tom: properly. Yep. I think you'll, you'll find a way, you know, like even if it leads you to a pathway where you have to lose staff for a period of time. Lose staff. Yeah. If you had to like Well, 
Tim: I've, I, I've told everyone about the position that we're in. Yeah. That was a she conversation.
Yeah. I think I. That was before you and I thought when I was not in a great place. 
Tom: Yeah, it's tough. It's tough, man. Yeah, but you, you've just gotta, I've never had to do that before. That's the main point. You've gotta realize that you are here to keep this company running, number one, and keep everyone else happy and engaged in the work.
Number two. But like if the company goes under, they don't have a job anyway. Yeah, true. Yeah. So I don't feel bad about it. You're just doing, yeah. I. I don't like, I, I 
Tim: spent, I did quite a lot of reflection, um, since all of that cause I was in a bad place. Um, but I've been working on good strategies and since been working, actually, I've got myself back into, you know, a more objective mindset, recognizing all of the really awesome things and that it's.
Really not a, a mark on my ability that we're like right here. 
Tom: It's, you're in the valley of death. That's okay. Yeah, it's okay. It's just part of the business cycle, mate. Like you're in the hardest part. 
Tim: Um, yeah. For almost the funnest part. Fucking hell. I like, I'm so excited. 
Tom: Still ready? I'm so excited for getting that moment.
Got I got. Bye. Good luck with it. I'd be keen to sort of build this with you. Yeah, I'm keen to like, but now like pleasure stand out. Actually, I.

# Tim, Simon and Eric

﻿Tim (ConceptV CEO), Eric (Director of Aura Ventures) and Simon (director of Base Capital) 12 May 2023 (GPT some names have been mis allocated here, separate Tim from the others):












Tim: This is the third time I've been to Sydney. The whole effort of going to an airport and getting on a plane, whether it's an hour flight or a three-hour flight, it's just as annoying.


Eric: In Australia, we don't see the point of doing interstate for a holiday.


Simon: This is the beauty of being miles from everywhere else in the world. What's the flight time to Bali?


Tim: Five to six hours.


Simon: I suppose you guys go to Bali.


Tim: We don't really have destinations like Mar DiUS. 


Simon: That's an international flight scene. I hate you guys. 


Eric: I never really thought of it that way. Like you guys would have the same issue.


Simon: Trying to go anywhere in Australia is a lot of effort. It's really cool here though.


Tim: I know that it's a six and a half hour flight to Bali because I was there and everything was fine until I fell off my moped and hurt my tailbone. Then I got really sick and I couldn't eat or drink anything for two days. The flight back was the worst.


Simon: So, I have mixed feelings about going places.


Tim: And you don't mind having a butler everywhere, like they show in the ads.


Eric: I never really understood purchasing a car until last year when I was traveling. In the US I felt poor, but in Bangkok and Bali, I felt wealthy.


Tim: At some point, both of you need to visit me in Cape Pine.


Simon: But how much do Ubers cost around there? I go to the North Shore for like $20.


Tim: That same trip's going to cost you $6. I caught a $40 Uber this morning for a 15-20 minute drive. I refuse to use Ubers if I'm in the middle of the city heading out.


Eric: It's faster to go directly to the cab rank.


Tim: It's more convenient to pay for an Uber to pick you up and take you home. Public transport is a hassle.


Eric: No chance. But a taxi is fine.


Tim: Seriously? Ubers are more expensive than taxis?


Eric: They price proof it. It's not ingrained in our habits.


Tim: Is that the case in Brisbane as well?


Simon: Could be.


Tim: My tactic is to start with low expectations.


Simon: Just to prove the idiocy point, what did you do? I heard you cut off your own thumb.


Tim: Yes, three years ago. I've been building stuff for ages. I grew up on a farm, so the mentality is to figure it out anyway. I was cutting up flyboard for a trade show and wasn't being safe. The table saw kicked back and my hand went right into the blade. It crushed the bone and ripped it out.


Simon: That sounds terrible.


Tim: They drilled in from the top bit of bone that was still there and then drilled it into my hand.


Eric: Wait, so that's the missing piece and they attached it?


Tim: Yes, the blade crushed that bit of bone and ripped it out. That's the little bit floating on top. There was like one millimeter of skin that was just flapping it off.


Simon: I texted my boss, telling him I couldn't make the trade show because I'd cut my thumb off. He thought I was joking and sent back a rude message.


Tim: I ended up calling a couple of friends. One came over and completed my work, while the other collected the trade show equipment.


Simon: The next day, my girlfriend took me from the hospital to the trade show. I was high on morphine and painkillers, still doing seminars and interviews.


Tim: I found three things difficult: picking up a coin, fidgeting with a small bead, and washing spoons while texting.


Simon: What's the dumbest way you've hurt yourself?


Eric: I once broke my foot trying to kick a soccer ball as high as I could. The ball was over-inflated and felt like a bowling ball.


Tim: It's unfortunate, but that's the job.


Eric: It's not just unfortunate, it's nonsensical. Take a football for example. It's designed for athletes to generate power and aim for a goal.


Simon: Yes, I agree. So you're saying one has to be smart and not just lucky?


Eric: Absolutely. But luck does play a role. Consider lottery for instance. You can't simply work your way to winning it, you need to buy a ticket.


Tim: That's right, buying a ticket is the first step. 


Simon: It's on the way to work.


Eric: Yes, and every time I buy a ticket, I feel like I'm improving my odds. Perhaps buying more increases the chances.


Simon: Let's start with one this week.


Eric: Sounds good. Remember when we saved last week? Maybe we can afford two this time.


Tim: That's a solid strategy. It's a game of probability, after all. The more you buy, the more chances to win. 


Simon: That's true.


Tim: Now, remember the time when the jackpot was a hundred million? We pooled in, and I was the one to buy the tickets. I had a good feeling about it, so much so that I missed my stop on the train. 


Simon: And you ended up losing your wallet.


Eric: Exactly. I was so stressed about losing the winning ticket that I paid $100 to get my wallet back.


Simon: So you were down $150.


Tim: Not to mention the potential hundred million.


Eric: But in the end, we won $1500. 


Simon: That was a brilliant move.


Tim: A great investment indeed.


Eric: It made me want to try my luck more often.


Simon: Let's do this.


Tim: Just remember, we're early-stage investors, not gamblers.


Eric: Of course, but I still enjoy trying my luck.


Simon: Once is enough, you've done well.


Eric: Yes, but it's interesting to note that despite missing all five numbers, we still won because of the power hit.


Simon: We could've been one of the 300 winners.


Eric: Yes, it was a rollercoaster of luck and unluck.


Simon: Yes, it was.


Tim: Now, let's talk about gambling.


Simon: There's so much advertisement around it.


Eric: In Australia, we even have the Melbourne Cup, where everyone gets excited. They even stop education for it.


Simon: When is the Melbourne Cup?


Eric: I think it's the first or second Tuesday of November.


Tim: That's correct. I remember in fourth grade, I had a good feeling about a particular horse. It was my teacher Ms. Bin who got me interested.


Simon: Tim, what's on your Christmas wish list?


Tim: I recall a time when someone was distributing small pieces of paper. One particular piece caught my attention.


Simon: And I won...


Tim: ...five Friday frogs. It was a big deal back then. 


Eric: That's a significant win in the playground economy. It's worth a lot, and it brought me many friends.


Tim: It gained me a lot of social standing.


Simon: It's like gambling.


Tim: Yes, it is.


Eric: I don't think it's as bad as...


Tim: ...the US. I believe you all are slightly smarter than us.


Simon: Thanks. Tim and I originally met at a pitch day. 


Tim: We connected mostly over digital matters, which I assume you and Mike also share.


Simon: At the last minute...


Tim: ...I received a message that the pitch was cancelled. I was disappointed but ended up spending 45 minutes getting advice from Simon.


Simon: Yes, I did help you out.


Tim: Hopefully, I'll give the same advice when you're in town.


Simon: Are you calling one of us an idiot?


Tim: I'm the one who broke my foot, so I'm the idiot. 


Simon: A broken foot is no laughing matter.


Eric: I broke my foot trying to kick something. Afterwards, I started drinking a lot of milk to recover.


Tim: You didn't break your foot kicking a soccer ball correctly, you did it wrong.


Eric: Actually, I broke my foot trying to defy gravity. I was trying to send the ball into space.


Tim: That's a story of a curious person trying to understand the world around them.


Eric: You're like Australia's Elon Musk, but with a broken foot.


Tim: Can you design a car?


Simon: No, but...


Eric: ...I can try to send a ball into space.


Simon: Are you training the next SpaceX engineer?


Tim: Not this time. 


Simon: We'll try again next week. How long are you in Sydney?


Tim: Until Saturday. I have some meetings, but we could meet for coffee.


Simon: That works. Let's meet after 2. Where are you based?


Tim: Two blocks from Monte Place, near Kings Cross. What email service do you use for work?


Simon: We use Office 365, but it's not great.


Tim: I use Zoho. I appreciate their attempt to disrupt the market.


Simon: Have you tried Superhuman?


Eric: It's hard to justify the $30 monthly fee, but it's useful. It has lots of shortcuts and helps me get to inbox zero.


Simon: If it saves you time, it's worth it.


Tim: Absolutely, even if it saves just an hour a day, it's worth the $30. What's a few hundred dollars in the grand scheme of things?


Eric: I agree. 


Simon: I'll give it a go. 


Tim: One day, I'll show you how it works.


Simon: Please do. 


Eric: We should go to a park and film this.


Tim: It's like sending a video to Elon Musk.


Simon: And getting Twitter verified.


Simon: Something amusing happened. This guy, 


Tim: It sometimes looks like a phallic symbol. I'm more concerned about your perception.


Simon: That's hilarious. But remember, all shapes and sizes.


Tim: I was with friends and one took a picture of the sunset. It was shortly after my thumb injury, so I was making jokes. The photo ended up looking like a phallic symbol. My cousin, a nurse, shared the story with her surgeon colleagues. It was an awkward moment.


Simon: What's in the background?


Eric: Who is that guy? 


Simon: That's the next model of the ex. It's so aerodynamic.


Tim: Have you seen Sabar's new gadget? 


Simon: No.


Tim: He rounded the top because of a movie.


Eric: He admitted that it doesn't affect aerodynamics, but he thought it was funny.


Tim: It's fun to be a meme character in real life.


Simon: It's enjoyable to throw Easter eggs if you're skilled at something. That's a legacy.


Tim: When I'm 70, I want to look back and enjoy how much I trolled everyone.


Simon: There's a story about my cousin, a photographer.


Tim: He wanted to do a Steve Jobs-type shot. The photo turned out to be humorous. I decided to use it for staff gifts, printing it on mugs.


Simon: You got targeted by an ad for that?


Tim: Yes, and it seemed like a good idea at the time. 


Simon: You printed a lot of those mugs.


Tim: Yes, I did. I forgot about them until my girlfriend found the delivery. I started leaving the mugs at friends' houses. It was rewarding when they found them later.


Simon: Why do you have this picture of me? Are you planning to print them?


Tim: I got new headshots done recently. I'm thinking of printing them as stickers and hiding them in seldom-used places. I also found heat-based mugs that show an image when hot. We've even made a 3D model to hide in the products we deliver.


Simon: Has anyone ever noticed?


Tim: No, but we are planning to run a campaign in two years where if you can spot all the hidden images, you'll win a prize.


Eric: So you're doing 3D renders?


Tim: Yes, we're focusing on architecture and privacy. I could place the 3D model in one of the neighboring properties. We've also recently discovered how to incorporate moving images into the online versions, so I'm thinking of including a hidden video too.


Simon: You're having a lot of fun with this.


Tim: Yes, it's important to enjoy the process. When I started, I knew it would be a long journey and now we're at a point where we can have fun with our work.


Eric: It's crucial to have fun where you can.


Tim: Definitely. I see it as a slingshot strategy. You grind until you reach a certain point, and then you can just have fun. We reached that point about three months ago.


Simon: So, how do you think your professional pitch is going?


Tim: I hope I come across as succinct and to the point.


Eric: You're doing a great job of tying in different concepts and simplifying language.


Tim: We're on the same page; you want to invest in Alex's venture.


Simon: And you're willing to risk your money on it.


Eric: You both are exactly the partners I've been seeking. It'll be a fun journey with potential challenges. 


Simon: I've already sacrificed a lot for this, so I'm in.


Tim: We need to start first thing tomorrow morning. 


Simon: After a long day of travel, I just arrived in Sydney. 


Tim: My partner is worried that I might move here soon. 


Simon: I'm open to the idea of moving. 


Eric: Australia has the best food. It's about the quality of the ingredients.


Simon: So you're talking about ingredient quality rather than the cuisine?


Eric: Exactly. It's the best on average. You'll find good food in Europe, but it lacks variety.


Simon: So you're saying the US has poor quality food?


Eric: Yes, even their steaks aren't good.


Tim: I've traveled a bit, and I can confirm, the food and coffee in the US aren't good.


Simon: That explains the prevalence of Starbucks there.


Tim: And that's why Starbucks couldn't establish itself in Australia.


Eric: Starbucks didn't make it here because it wasn't good enough.


Simon: They expanded quickly in the US, then opened a bunch of stores in Brisbane.


Tim: But they had to close most of them within two years.


Simon: There are only a few left now.


Tim: It was a failed business case.


Simon: But they do like their IPAs in the US.


Tim: Yes, especially in San Francisco.


Simon: A lot of IPAs there.


Eric: Speaking of drinks, when I sent the invite for this meet-up, I named it Castle Lago. I had to look up South African beers to find a name.


Tim: We manufacture about 20% of the world's beer.


Simon: That's astonishing.


Eric: At my local pub, I can get two beers for five dollars.


Simon: That's quite a deal.


Tim: But this city is expensive, especially property and dining.


Simon: You'd typically pay around 30 to 40 dollars for a meal here.


Eric: You could pay that for two people elsewhere.


Tim: But the higher salaries here offset the cost of living.


Simon: Have I told you about the power situation here?


Eric: My apartment's electricity will be out intermittently tomorrow: between midnight and 2:30 AM, 6 and 10:30 AM, and 4 and 6:30 PM.


Tim: Someone must have developed an app due to frustrations with similar issues.


Eric: This issue has been persistent for years.


Simon: It paints a confusing picture. On one hand, I want to go, but on the other, I'm not so sure.


Tim: My younger brother lives in the UK. Every time he visits Cape, he's reminded of its paradise-like qualities despite power issues.


Simon: You guys would have an incredible time there.


Tim: I don't know much about travel, based on my experience with Bali.


Simon: Just remember to bring your donuts.


Eric: There's no better place than Australia in the summer, be it Sydney or Brisbane.


Simon: I prefer cooler weather, but most people love Brisbane's summer.


Eric: Sydney's weather is perfect, Melbourne is hot enough on most days.


Tim: Some days it's so hot, you step out and immediately want to retreat to the air conditioning.


Simon: How did you guys meet?


Eric: It's easier to invest as an investor.


Tim: I could just text you to meet up, it's not weird.


Simon: It's common among venture teams.


Eric: We lost one to South Africa.


Tim: We gained one guy.


Simon: Excuse me for 10 minutes.


Eric: Brisbane and Sydney will eventually merge into one city, but it's a 100-year plan.


Simon: Infrastructure growth is slow.


Tim: In the late sixties, a traffic advisor from San Francisco suggested cutting off public transport and building highways.


Simon: A typical Californian approach.


Tim: It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now it's problematic. Brisbane built one freeway, cut off some train stations, and discontinued the tram. Now they're facing challenges.


Simon: At least we have electricity.


Eric: I can hardly imagine power outages.
Simon: They're disruptive.
Eric: Even a fire alarm test annoys me, but an outage is a whole other level.
Tim: It's more complicated than it needs to be.
Simon: It happens monthly.
Tim: Is that due to your building's age?
Eric: Over the top safety regulations are part of it, especially in Sydney. I prefer Melbourne's more laid-back approach.
Simon: Sydney tends to be overprotective.
Eric: If people can't learn from their mistakes, let natural selection take its course.
Tim: I've learned from my mistakes and improved.
Simon: And you've survived.
Tim: I think of this as an upgrade.
Simon: It's like we're trying to balance the American and British systems of law, finding a middle ground between total freedom and strict regulation.
Tim: Despite some odd rules, we've done well overall.
Simon: Except for the ban on soccer balls in the city.
Tim: Those rules are too strict.
Eric: Singapore's system is impressive.
Simon: Interesting.
Tim: These rules, though recent, have affected Singapore's tourism.
Simon: Most of their tourism is business-related anyway.
Eric: They've managed issues like legalized prostitution pragmatically to control potential harm.
Simon: They've established principle-based rules.
Eric: They enforce rules strictly, especially new ones. They rule by fear.
Simon: You were lucky when you violated the littering rule.
Eric: I didn't see a single police officer during my month-long stay there.
Tim: There might be strong community enforcement.
Simon: They seem to tolerate tourists' mistakes more.
Tim: It's a matter of balance.
Simon: You've got an outgoing personality, Eric.
Eric: I don't enjoy it.
Simon: It can be uncomfortable.
Tim: It's challenging to be thrust into social situations.




Eric: I respect those who can build their own brand and overcome imposter syndrome. However, I hesitate to publicly make bold statements if I feel I haven't earned the right to do so.


Tim: People tend to accept what's been promoted through an authority as gospel, a phenomenon visible during Trump's presidency.


Simon: It's problematic when someone asks you a question, expecting you to have all the answers.


Eric: When it comes to first-time site managers or other partners, I prefer to stay quiet unless I've worked with them long enough to understand their situation and offer valuable advice. Giving general observations and recommendations can be more harmful than beneficial.


Tim: As a founder, people are always seeking advice. They often preface their statements with disclaimers, highlighting that it's just their opinion. But the moment their words are put on a reported platform or online, everything gets misconstrued.


Simon: It creates a divide where some people are comfortable speaking on camera, while others, who perhaps should be speaking, opt to stay silent.


Tim: I'd argue for you to keep sharing your personal account, including your background and experiences, while also acknowledging that you're not always right. General feedback can be helpful, and if the audience knows your area of expertise, they can use your advice accordingly.


Simon: That makes sense.


Eric: We'll catch up tomorrow, right?


Tim: Yeah, I initially thought our meeting place was four hours away, but it's actually just 10 minutes from where I am. We could meet for a late lunch around 1:30?


Simon: Sounds good.


Tim: If you want to know more about what we do, you can scan this QR code.


Eric: Is this the email I should send?


Tim: Yes, this is for people I meet in person.


Simon: It's a neat concept.


Tim: I'm considering potential name rebrands, by the way. I've also been working on a crude business AI that can help with organization and documentation. Any suggestions are welcome.


Tim: I've set up a voice recording function to discuss business elements, tasks, and assignments. At the end of every day, it processes the information into categories for my team to see.


Simon: Always closely observe people like Boston Current. I'll text you in two years.


Tim: I once walked away with a giant blotch on my butt.


Simon: That's unique. I should stop talking, really.


Simon: He's a great guy, very ambitious, a bit like me. I think he's got a bit of an ego.


Tim: We got a New Zealand-based business, Univers flag, in the architectural space. Have you guys discussed it?


Simon: It's an interesting space. Architects are unique.


Tim: Given my track history, even if I know the right way, I'll still get lost. Should I go to Wynyard Station or Town Hall station, or should I catch an Uber?


Simon: I'm tempted by the latter, but I'd suggest catching the train. It's not a rush.


Tim: Okay, I'll catch the train then.


Simon: So, go straight down here to Tunnel Station, platform 5. That's a number you should remember.
