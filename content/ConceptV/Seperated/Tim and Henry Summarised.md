Henry (advisor) and Tim (Ceo ConceptV) 7th may 2023


Henry: You could create a one-page chart showing revenue by customer, with each customer numbered. This shows diverse revenue. Have a stacked column chart that shows revenue by use case. Mention that there are seven major clients at the moment across a diverse set of use cases. Explain current performance.


Tim: How should I approach different types of revenue, like repeat business or subscription-based?


Henry: For a two-month window, include a third column in the stacked column chart showing revenue types. Create a visual representation without numbers, just proportions. This will help explain the diverse set of customers and use cases.


Tim: I want to change the messaging to focus on the Property Wizard and submarkets.


Henry: Describe your grand ambition, then talk about the next 18 months. Discuss the current two-month pipeline and set a 12-month goal. Explain how diverse your revenue is by customer, use case, sub-industry, and revenue type. State your aspirations for the next 12 months and how you plan to achieve them. Mention that conversations have already started.


Tim: So start with the two-month pipeline, then the 12-month milestone with investments.


Henry: Yes, focus on the first 12 months and the huge property ecosystem. This is the first step on a long journey to tapping into the entire real estate market.


Tim: I'm wondering if I should mention our deep connection to leading-edge AI and incubator programs since AI is an attractive topic.


Henry: You could have two separate pages: one covering your team and their expertise, and another for tech partnerships like Amazon and leading-edge AI. You can present them together to show you have the right people and relationships to achieve your goals. As for mentioning AI, be genuine about the tools you're using rather than just using the term "AI" flippantly. Mention specific tools to demonstrate credibility.


Tim: We should mention how we're developing our system to be more variable cost-based, using PT four and models to convert our system to 80% variable cost base with affordable foreign labor.


Henry: Focus on one or two examples to show that you're serious about using AI and leading-edge tools. For instance, mention using GPT-4 to automate a task for offshore labor, reducing handling time. Also, discuss using transcription AI and multimodal GPT-4 for internal business communication.


Tim: My challenge is constructing the right narrative from all the different things we're doing.


Henry: Your audience likely doesn't know much about your business, so use concise and clear tables or visuals. Consider creating a timeline with product systems and initiatives, showing their current stage and future plans.


Tim: I thought about a timeline for product systems and initiatives, showing where they're at and where they're going.


Henry: You can create a grid with rows for different elements of running your business, such as people, product, and tech stack. Use columns for where you are today, line of sight for the next 18 months, and aspirations for the next three years. This can help illustrate where you need partnership and support.


Tim: What do you mean by products?


Henry: We're going from a standard set of products to a toolkit so others can build on top of our products. You'll have to define these for your business.


Tim: How should I define products? Should I use active tools or developed market tools instead?


Henry: You could say "initial toeholds in all major real estate use cases" for today, and "expanded (two to three customers) in each major real estate submarket" for the future.


Tim: What should I include for additional submarkets?


Henry: The point of the page is to articulate what your business does now, what you'll be able to do in 18 months, and where you imagine being in three years across products, customers, tech, and the caliber of people in your business. Write two dot points in each box for today, 18 months, and the future.


Tim: I could list 10 customers across five markets for today and 40 customers across eight markets for 18 months.


Henry: For tech stack, mention international expansion in the future. You need the funding mainly for the people box. Explain that you need their investment for that and their relationships for industry investors. The strategy is going from the current state to the 18-month plan and eventually to the future state.


Tim: So, the industry investors go on a different page?


Henry: Yes, this page is for explaining the strategy and why you need the funding.


Tim: Where should I put this page in the deck?


Henry: Place it behind the page that discusses what you'll do with the funding. This page could outline your strategy. Although you might decide it doesn't fit in the deck, having a clear understanding of this information is crucial for investor conversations. Use this page to refine your pitch.


Tim: People suggested showing growth without investment and growth with investment to emphasize that we're not raising capital because we'll run out of cash but to take advantage of opportunities.


Henry: Personally, I would create a slide with a clear title emphasizing that you'll reach your goals with or without investment, but it'll take longer without it. For example, it might take two years without investment but only six months with it. The purpose of taking investments is to supercharge growth.


Henry: Investment will take us two months, serving as a foundation for growth. Use our hit lists, which can help achieve growth four times faster.


Tim: In terms of showing burn rates and profitability, how should I calculate that?


Henry: Base calculations on revenue from customers and run a genuine forecast table. Keep in mind the range of time the business could last without revenue. For this raise, plan for an 18-month horizon. Within that time, the business may either need to raise more capital or become cash positive and not require additional funding.


Tim: How should I calculate the runway?


Henry: If things don't go well, the raise should provide at least 18 months of oxygen. Telling the truth favorably is the best strategy. The business is built on a fixed cost system that's operational, focusing now on selling and scaling customers.


Tim: How should I talk about the Property Wizard tool?


Henry: Call it a platform. The proprietary tech platform can provide various products in the real estate industry. The plan is to expand the product set as needed using the already-built platform.


Tim: One valuable aspect of Property Wizard is its standardized and modular nature, which allows us to serve various markets and accept different software and file formats. The process remains consistent regardless of the product or market, making us more flexible and efficient than our competitors.


Henry: Emphasize the lack of tech debt, modularity, and flexibility. This allows us to quickly serve clients, regardless of their systems. Our ability to accept any file format from any market participant gives us an advantage over competitors with limited capabilities.


Tim: Our competitors' platforms are often clunky, expensive, and incompatible with certain software, which is why clients choose us. We are more affordable and adaptable.


Henry: While these points don't need to be in the presentation deck, having them in mind allows for concise and structured communication with potential investors, customers, or anyone interested in the business.


Tim: One of the main things I'm constantly trying to work on is improving communication.


Henry: It's difficult because there's a significant information boundary to grapple with.


Tim: We're working on incorporating GPT-4 into our system for the Property Wizard. It currently takes in data from various softwares to create virtual tours, but we aim to make it a two-way information exchange. With GPT-4 and other background developments, we can automate changes based on user input.


Henry: That's a great vision for your business. It will be industry-changing, and people will spend less time designing.


Tim: I have different versions of my pitch, like the one-pager, 12-pager, and pitch slides. The 12-pager is dense and takes time to read. Should I create an eight-page version highlighting key points?


Henry: Instead, consider writing a two or three-page memo. It can convey the important points effectively.


Henry: I'll send you the memo I wrote for the cattle investment. It's nine pages long and explains our strategy in a narrative format. The first page is an executive summary, and then it dives into the necessary details. It's simple and informative.


Tim: Would this go before or after the 12-page document?


Henry: I suggest having two or three documents ready. A one-pager as a brief introduction, an 8-10 page deck, and potentially a memo like the one I shared. Memos allow you to tell a story and deliver your message clearly. They help you get your thoughts in order, so when you speak with someone, you can explain your ideas coherently.


Tim: My final question is about strategy. My biggest restriction is time. I'm understaffed, and I'm caught up with managing cashflow. I'm considering going back to my investors for a six-month short-term loan, with a fixed interest rate and a convertible note after six months, giving the lender an option.


Henry: I recommend going for a smaller investment from industry players. If you have some interested, take what they offer at your current valuation. Their investment can be a convertible anyway, which is a common and simple way of doing a raise. Focus on getting as much as you can as soon as you can and then move on to your work.


Tim: My main concern is immediate short-term funding, but the cash flow side is difficult.


Henry: The two institutional investors are offering 500 in total, but these deals can take a long time. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about that.


Tim: That's why I was considering going back to existing investors, the time it would take them to provide funds is too long for my immediate needs.


Henry: If you can raise funds from existing investors at a high valuation, that would be valuable for you.


Tim: I might be able to make a six-month arrangement work. We get 15% fixed or ordinary shares at today's valuation, which is based on industry investors at four million, higher than what they initially invested.


Henry: This business is simultaneously worth 10 million and zero. If you can find six months of funding at a four-million pre-money valuation, take it and consider it a seed funding round. You could say you went through pre-seed funding, seed funding, and then proceed to Series A. Since you have customers and products, you're at Series A level. This coherent story might be believable. 


Tim: Part of the capital is for hiring a business development manager to free up my time. With committed Grant and a pipeline for the next two months, I'd be comfortable. I'm connected to good VCs and making progress. I want to give myself at least two months before pitching to them.


Henry: If you're raising from a new source, they might not like the idea because it's effectively an overdraft loan. Go back to whoever's already on the capital stack and suggest the seed funding idea. Update them on the Series A progress and propose an intermediary funding of six months between now and then. Raise at the same valuation, which is favorable for them. Anyone outside of the existing register might not be keen on this unless you can accelerate the full Series A process.


Tim: I don't need six months, more like two months. If I ask for a short-term loan, it might raise suspicion. Instead, I'll request funding to ensure we're in good shape for the next six months and our upcoming Series A round.


Henry: That makes sense. What's the funding situation?


Tim: I have five investors, two of which have invested significant amounts. If I can get them to invest an additional 30K each, that should be enough.


Henry: Is the funding guaranteed?


Tim: The R&D funding of 100K should come in August, but the date is uncertain. There's 160K in the sales pipeline, which should close within two months. The venture capital and industry funding is committed, but contingent on sales.


Henry: Focus on the story for investors and try to accelerate revenue from customers. The tax situation is out of your control, but getting customers to pay up is something you can work on.


Tim: I'm struggling with managing my time, and it's affecting the business growth. I want to get funding to address this issue, but I need to work on many initiatives.


Henry: Your options are limited. Approach investors asking for 80 at a 4 million valuation to be in a strong position. Gauge their response and adjust the terms if necessary. Consider offering a 6-month term with a 15% annualized interest, paid upon repayment of the principal. If you can pay off the debt, this could work in your favor.


Tim: The difficulty with the six-month plan is the volume of opportunity. However, it's unlikely that anyone outside the company will invest unless they're familiar with the business.


Henry: If someone's willing to write you debt, go for it. Start the interest rate at zero and slowly increase it until someone accepts. Offer a 10% interest rate with a 12-month term or convertible equity at their discretion.


Tim: That makes sense. I'll discuss this with an investor during dinner tonight.


Henry: Explain that you're preparing for a Series A and want to be in good shape for it. Mention the 4 million valuation and how they'd be on equal footing with existing investors.


Tim: Before that, I'll highlight the most compelling parts of our story. I don't want to approach VCs too early.


Henry: Which VCs are you talking to?


Tim: I can't recall all the names, but some include Carona Blackbirds, Toga, and another one with Forest or Woods in the name. There are two others as well.


Henry: VCs are good at saying no and referring you to another VC. The hit rate is around 1-2%, so don't be discouraged when most businesses don't work out. It's normal to look at hundreds of businesses before finding one that succeeds. A lot of work goes into finding the right investment.


Tim: I've learned a lot in the past five years. This is a good time for me to be doing this.


Henry: With your business, there's a 70% chance of it working out well and a 30% chance of it not. Worst case, if the business goes bankrupt, you'll still be fine personally. As long as you act responsibly and follow director's duties, you can always get a job. The technology you've built will always belong to you.


Tim: I have a corporate structure to separate everything.


Henry: Many people in business don't take their director duties seriously enough. Your downside is relatively low. The worst-case scenario is getting a job. If you had a bakery, for example, and it went bankrupt, you'd lose all your assets and investments. In your case, you'd still have your software suite and could rebuild with minimal cost.
