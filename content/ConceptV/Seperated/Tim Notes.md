Tim's Note to Self (21st April2023):


When talking to current investors, discuss the following points:


1. Number of clients and industries you are in, as well as industries you're moving into and strategic investors in each.
2. Your strategy footholds and the progress made.
3. The two to three-month revenue pipeline of $165,000 spread evenly across nine customers in five industries.
4. Upcoming webinar targeting architects in Australia and the 63% conversion rate from cold calls based on the soft launch in the architecture space.
5. High profit margin on your products.
6. Tamara joining the team and how her expertise will help in recycling the strategy in the designer, landscape architecture, and drafting spaces.
7. Eight contacts at five venture capital or angel companies and warm introductions to 10 venture capital firms.
8. The Research and Development incentive potentially providing $100,000 in September.


Explain that the funding is needed to capitalize on opportunities and manage workload. Much of your time is spent on immediate cash flow, and while you plan to hire a business development manager, sourcing new clients takes at least three months.






Notes to Self 3:


Tim's Note to Self:


Emphasize the current opportunity in the go-to-market strategy. Highlight the competition and the value of the Property Wizard. With our system, we can offer a superior product with 10 times the value and an 82% profit margin. Explain the residential boom and gather data on pre-sales. Discuss the increasing demand for builders and how our product can provide a superior solution at a more affordable price.


Mention the extension to major product specification libraries and recent legal changes. Our system can improve these systems, generating subscription costs or licensing fees. Discuss connections to key people and the estimated value of the annual recurring revenue percentage.


Timing is crucial due to legal changes and upcoming projects. Address the lumpy revenue, tight cash flow, and lean margin. Reach out to Ronan about a potential investment from Mode Design, contingent on raising additional funds through VCs.


Discuss the development of the system and the benefits for architecture tools. Write a letter outlining the investment and its impact. When discussing staffing, mention changes in burn rate and required revenue. Show what the investment gets you and set minimum requirements for generating revenue.


Finally, talk about the developer initiative and go-to-market strategy for developers, showing how you can get clients on board.


Tim: After discussing the developer initiative, focus on the go-to-market strategy for developers, showcasing how we can onboard clients within three months with targeted approaches. The construction industry is slowing down, which will affect many industries relying on revenue. Our tools are designed to facilitate revenue and decrease costs. We plan to hire more people and create different scenarios for our pitch and pitch deck.


Tim: Utilize connections to get supplier contacts, gather their input on pricing and desired features for the product we built for Selector. Work on various quality levels during the shuttle pitch, experimenting with different detail levels. Bring AI and software development investment partners on board. Have a marketable product with people paying for it at specific price points.


Tim: Design a process that is 20 times more efficient within six months, and have the right team members ready to go. When hiring a business development manager (BDM), use connections to find the right person with experience in the property industry. Reframe the construction tool to include a quantity surveying tool that reads construction and architectural plans, auto-generating required quantities. Network with major players in the sales space across Australia.


Tim: Attend events to find the right BDM and focus on the strength of the product we offer in the developer space, providing a superior product compared to virtual tour businesses. Offer renders and virtual tours at a competitive price. Incorporate a SWOT analysis into the pitch and pitch deck, outlining how potential issues can be solved with VC investment.


Tim: Schedule trips to Sydney and Melbourne, connecting with developers and building partnerships. Consider partnering with Walker Hill and seeking investment from them. Enhance efficiency in various industries, such as manufacturing and architecture. Create materials for developers that include renders, virtual tours, and pricing examples. Explore opportunities for grants, seminars, and networking events to boost our reputation. Finally, increase our online presence through architect websites and social media posts.


Tim's Note to Self:


Conduct extensive research into the developer market and competitors, using a professional agency. In the pitch, emphasize the opportunity, the ability to fill it, and the proven potential. Focus on the market strategy and hire a salesperson to be fully operational within a month.


Based on historical data, if the salesperson performs at 80% of your level, they should win a specific number of jobs to reach capacity. Combine this information with research on the developer market, competitive landscape, and opportunities. Deploy the business development manager (BDM) strategically.


Instruct your team to find all relevant events and seminars to connect with potential clients. Plan the BDM's schedule around these events and presentations. Document this initiative and estimate its potential revenue impact.


Mention the revolutionary technology developed over six years and the supply chain improvements made. Create concise project proposals based on collected data, covering a variety of scopes.


Position someone who has built solutions and is currently well-defined to take advantage of the opportunities. Provide examples from various sectors, including residential architecture, commercial development, and property management. Highlight the innovative system being built for the industry.


Tim's Note to Self:


For our go-to-market strategy, emphasize the current opportunity. We have competitors in the market offering an inferior product at higher prices. With our Property Wizard, we can deliver a superior product with 10 times the value at the same price as renders, maintaining an 82% profit margin. There's a huge opportunity due to the residential boom, and many pre-sales are slow to market, causing demand to slow.


Construction costs are rising, putting many developments and builders out of business, increasing demand for our tools. As we enter the market, we can provide a superior product at a significantly lower price, making it accessible to everyone.


Legal changes are affecting the industry, increasing the demand for product specification libraries. Our system allows us to improve these systems and charge subscription or licensing fees. We have connections to key industry players, with an estimated annual recurring revenue percentage.


Timing is crucial due to the legal changes and the number of upcoming projects. We need to grow and develop our system further. Consider approaching Mode Design for an industry investment with a condition of raising an additional $750k through VCs.


Discuss burn rate changes and show what the investment gets us in terms of revenue. Present our go-to-market strategy for developers and demonstrate that we can onboard clients within three months using targeted approaches. The construction industry is slowing down, and many businesses are struggling, emphasizing the need for our product in the market.


Industries focused on revenue will face challenges. We have tools to facilitate revenue and reduce cost, which is why we plan to hire many people. Create scenarios in Excel for pitches and pitch decks, particularly for Lindsay.


Conduct a survey among supplier contacts to determine their willingness to pay for the product we built for selector and their desired features. Prepare a shuttle pitch with six different quality levels and make suggestions for the next session. Bring on board AI and software developers, send investment partners to the third stakeholder, and develop a marketable product with appropriate pricing points.


Design a process 20 times more efficient within six months and gather the right team members. When hiring a BDM, leverage connections to find the right person who can generate product offerings for the sales side and has strong networking in the property industry.


Integrate a quantity surveying tool into the construction tool that can read construction plans and architect plans, auto-generating required quantities. Build this into the selector or specifier tool, enabling architects to get real-time cost estimates on materials. Attend events and network to find major players in the sales space across Australia.


Focus on the strength of the product in the developer space, offering a superior product compared to virtual tour businesses. Include a SWOT analysis in the pitch and pitch deck, addressing potential issues solvable with VC investment. Establish partnerships with property developers, seek investment from them, and explore opportunities.


Develop a more efficient product with pre-built features, renders, and virtual tours at competitive pricing. Attend seminars and property council shows to build reputation and network. Collaborate with architects to create an attractive online presence.


Tim: The advisory board in the networks and potentially previous investors. I can talk high level about the purpose of funding and what I'm looking for from it, such as networks, doors to be opened, additional experience, and funding. We're raising funding now to expedite our plans.


During the five years of research and development leading up to June 2022, we built an impressive product. The video showcases the product's versatility, ease of use, and aggregated information. The product was built because the industry is currently decentralized with different stakeholders that need to cooperate together. Existing software doesn't communicate well, leading to complications, design flaws, and time losses. Our product consolidates everything into a single, intuitive space.


To create something applicable to various use cases, we developed the property wizard. It's a standardized process that takes any data input and translates it into a virtual tour. I can talk about the timing story, where there's a push from the end client for newer innovations and better technology. Existing technology is laborious and difficult to use, and people don't want to change. Our key factors of success include ease of implementation and a seamless property wizard designed to translate whatever gets thrown into it.


Pearl: The Property Wizard allows hydraulics teams, architects, and designers to continue their work without needing to change their methods or learn anything new. They simply upload their work to a server, and the system translates the data and makes it accessible for everyone.


Tim: To introduce timing, you can discuss how COVID-19 changed the way people interact with architects and sales agents, driving change in a resistant industry. External factors are now pushing for it. You can then mention that thousands of people have tried doing this before but failed due to change and timing. The industry needs change, but it requires cooperation from every stakeholder, who often lack individual incentives.


Pearl: We approach this holistically, recognizing the need for individual benefits without added cost and effort. Regarding timing, the industry has been slow to change, but post-COVID clients now demand better technology and interfaces. This drives companies to seek innovative ways to practice.


Tim: Discuss the widespread movement across different markets and the various applications. During the research and development period, the Property Wizard has been tested in multiple markets. The holistic approach has extreme applications.


Pearl: You can then discuss the timing of the business and link it to the timing of the industry. Mention the soft launch stage in June last year, intending to test market response and identify potential issues.


Tim: We wanted to see where our system was weak and what people needed that we didn't have. The response we got was eight times greater than we anticipated. Out of 155 companies contacted, over 60% were keen to take us up on an initial trial. 


Tim: So, after explaining that, I can give an overview of the applications for the market, like what's happening with our target market in the luxury residential sector. 


Tim: I was going to tie it together by discussing the different markets we've tested in and the success we've had. We've reached the point where we're moving into the next stage of our company, focusing on one specific market. 


Tim: We're facilitating businesses meeting the demand through on-seller arrangements by providing them with white-label products. They configure and purchase a product from us, which they then sell to their clients. This could be an architect to the end client, a sales agency to a developer, or a marketing agency to a developer. 


Tim: I'll discuss the SaaS aspect when talking about the property wizard, and the on-sell part where we're building the interface for clients to interact with when we switch over to SaaS. We're meeting the demand through the current service model. 


Tim: We're going for funding now for a few reasons, primarily because we've completed our research and development stage. We needed to automate significantly and a significant amount of work needed to go into the automation of complicated processes. 


Tim: I'll quickly brush back on the testing phase and partnerships, and then move on to the competition landscape. At this point, I haven't introduced the target market. I'll discuss the on-sell aspect and then focus on the target market and what it's doing now.


Framing Your Company, Pitch Structure, and Strategy:


Emphasize the current opportunity in your go-to-market strategy. Highlight how competitors charge more for inferior products, while your Property Wizard offers a superior product with ten times the value at a lower cost. Despite the high value offered, you maintain an 82% profit margin on every project.


Discuss the residential boom and gather data on pre-sales performance. Mention that many developments are slow to market and demand is starting to slow. With construction costs rising and supply struggling to meet demand, developers need your tools. Entering the market now allows you to provide a superior product at a lower price, making it available to everyone desperate to sell.


In the next six months, focus on the product supply side, building an extension to major product specification libraries. Address legal changes affecting builders and supplier desperation to reach architects. Your system can improve these systems while generating income from subscription costs or licensing fees.


Leverage connections and estimate the potential annual recurring revenue percentage of all fees. Timing is crucial due to legal changes and the number of upcoming projects. Though you operate on a lean margin, lumpy revenue and tight cash flow make growth challenging.


Consider seeking industry investment with conditions, such as raising additional funds through VCs. Explain that with investment, your system will be developed further, benefiting all parties involved.


When discussing hiring, address burn rate changes and required revenue as your team grows. Show how the investment gets you the necessary revenue and set minimum requirements for generating revenue within a specific time frame. Finally, present data on market growth and construction projects.


Title: Note to Self about Leadership


Tim, it's crucial to establish clear milestones and goals for the team. Right now, the team lacks direction and is merely focused on the immediate cash flow. You need to invest time in planning and prioritizing strategic steps to grow the company.


To move forward, create a replicable pipeline product, with a consistent sales process that doesn't require Liam and Jordy's involvement in every aspect. Both Liam and Jordy need specific instructions and guidance to be productive and contribute effectively.


It's essential to know and understand what each team member is doing. Have everyone discuss their job, record it, and process the information. This will provide a clearer picture of the team's work and help you determine your role in this scenario.


Leverage your connections and resources to grow the business, but to do so, you must be willing to take calculated risks and make time for strategic endeavors. Focus on reaping the benefits of the opportunities you've created, instead of being overly conservative and cash flow-driven.
