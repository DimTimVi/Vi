10 May 2023note to selfand your company:


Prepare a proposal for Angela's projects similar to the original OPD proposal. Include client-related details on the blue side and Angela-specific details on the orange side.


Liam needs to provide a floor plan shot of the Revit file. The marketing materials should include cards, VR goggle brochures, a user guide, and optional product and sales videos.


Detail the additional features such as analytics, surveys, the markup tool, and capturing. Describe Walker Hill and partner marketing. Detail the implementation of three projects from concept to detailed design to construction. Provide an overview of the construction tool markup and annotation tool.


Suggest applying discounts during a phone call. Propose a higher price to set a precedent and offer an exclusive discount or signing bonus from a third party for the marketing element. Angela will contribute towards part of the cost for her marketing, providing a good deal for her clients.


Consider including high-level renders and images as an option for higher paying elements. Outline three levels of detail: concept stage with estimated pricing, detail stage with estimated pricing, and marketing level detail with estimated pricing. Provide links to examples of each.


Use the proposal for Angela as a template for the AIA webinar and show it to current clients. Use the video made for Angela as a template for what can be offered to smaller architecture firms. 


Consider bringing Walker Hill into part of this project. Many small architecture companies lack robust marketing and visualization. The service can combine digital marketing and high-quality visualizations, providing a unique offering to the architecture industry.


Task for Tim: Email Bianca about the AIA webinar and send her the draft template to illustrate what's being offered. Include research data and expected revenue. Run an Excel sheet on anticipated uptake. 


Task for Jackie: Research higher-end development applications in the residential industry.


Don't limit the offering to residential; include commercial industry as well. Make a business case about repeating this in other industries. Get an estimate from Tamara on how many webinars she can arrange with industry bodies over the next three months. Use this data, along with survey results and proof of concepts, to estimate market penetration. Aim to capture a certain percentage of the market within six months. This is your key selling point.


Use the key selling point as the opening for your venture capitalist pitches. This is a compelling and truthful narrative. Subsequently, reference similar sized opportunities.


Consider the capital raise from a partnership perspective, partially composed of well-connected industry investors of significant size in strategic submarkets.


For your pitch, define your primary objective or phase one. For instance, with the architect offering through AIA and Tamara, there is a $7 billion industry in Australia.


In your phase two markets, over the next 6-18 months, there's considerable cash flow spread over various industries in which we currently operate.


Project that in 12 months, we could be servicing a sizeable portion of the market. Given six months of development, your system will be capable of servicing a significant amount of its potential using a variable cost base production and a highly automated system. 


In 18 months, the system will be capable of supporting a larger capacity. The only restriction on our capacity is resources, particularly staff.


Seek strategic partners for immediate capital, and support and consultancy to expand our business efficiently. Plans include international expansion in three years with an exit opportunity in five to seven.


Create a new eight-page pitch deck. Keep it simple with links to your product video and a one-pager detailing the system. Use a similar outline/message structure as this summary.


Introduce the team, then briefly explain the overarching problem where the design and construction industry sees significant transaction volumes but suffers from substantial friction.


Next, describe the cause, referencing the communication network diagram from the one-pager. Highlight the primary issues, including incompatible software across stakeholders, slow adoption of new technologies (supported by statistics and article link), and primitive information communication.


Simplify the issue of poor communication in the construction industry, where much of the technical data is shared through floor plans, leaving individuals to visualize the space and make decisions. This often leads to mistakes, design flaws, and variations due to human limitations.


Show a diagram of the Property Wizard in the next slide, including a link to the product video.
 
Start with the use cases slide, then create a short video for each use case, outlining the solution. Utilize existing screenshots and engage team members for voice overs. 


Before presenting the use cases, include a slide detailing the company's timeline. This chart should only cover the R&D stage, network creation/expansion, and strategic industry partnership development. Indicate GPT-4's role as a footnote on the graph. 


Next, add an implementation phase, divided into three stages. Phase one should span six months, phase two another six months, and phase three should cover the following 18 months. Mark the current point in time on this timeline. 


The next section, termed Phase One, Step One, highlights the design tool. Using the completed Property Wizard, it's noted that 80% of the Australian architect and designer industries can now access a white-labeled service.
