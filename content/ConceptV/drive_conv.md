# Alkot Studio (Interior Design)

 
Alkot Studio -  Barbara Albert  
Reference tour : https://conceptv.io/panotours/client/alkotstudio/conceptplan  
 
ConceptV is an innovative young company with a set of interesting solutions for interior 
designers. We were recommended to ConceptV by one of our clients, and after meeting with 
them and discussing the possibilities, they offered us a free proof of concept.  
 
Creating a design for a client takes a lot of back and forth, and we often run into problems 
where a client doesn’t fully comprehend what we’re proposing. In those situations, it can get 
difficult and time consuming to communicate our design and get useful responses.  
 
Our design process has mostly revolved around 2D  images we capture from Sketchup and 
reference images for the mood and style we’re envisioning. It works, but we can’t fully 
express and get feedback on what the intent is as we’re limited to what’s available and 
affordable.  
 
With ConceptV’s virtual tours  proposals should be much easier, especially for clients who 
aren’t very good at visualising. Their platform works with all the software we use, and the 
fact it’s readily available should make it much easier delivering proposals. We’re able to build 
in information panels inside the tour, so anything we need to explain or point out to the client 
is right there for them to see.  
 
We can also use tours of our projects to boost our marketing. Having this up on our website 
or sending one over to a potential clie nt gives us a strong point of difference and could easily 
generate new business.  
 
The proof of concept was a great exercise to test how we work together, and how we can 
improve the end result. Since we’ve received the tour, we’ve had a couple of feedback 
sessions to discuss   some redesign areas, learn about new tools and also to plan for more 
efficient future collaboration. 
 
From a pricing perspective, the prices we’ve been given are affordable and tailored to each 
project. By using ConceptV, we can reduce a lot of the non-design work we currently do in 
house.  
 
We’ll be using an updated version of this tour in our portfolio and on our website, to show the 
idea to other clients and attract more high-end business. We are working towards building 
the cost of t he virtual tours into our fees, as an optional project delivery option. We believe 
that future clients will be excited to see their projects come to life with an interactive model, 
and that many will pay the extra cost for it.  
 
ConceptV is bringing a much needed change to how design projects can be presented and 
shared between professionals and clients. We support their application for the Ignite Ideas 
Fund.  
 
Regards,  
Barbara Albert

# All Recommendation Letters

To whom it may concern,
My name is Diana French, my husband Peter and I are retired cotton farmers in Theodore,
Queensland. Our son and his wife will be moving into our old house and have taken over the
running of the farm.
2 years ago, Peter and I started designing a new home for ourselves. We approached Westbuilt
Homes, one of the few modular home builders that transport homes so far out. The house was
finished a month ago, and we're now settling in.
The prccess of designing was straight forward, but difficult. We met with the Westbuiit Homes
team in person three times, once for the initial briefing, once for colour selection, and eince for a
final walkthrough. Westbuilt Homes are based in Warwich which is a 5 hour drive each way
from Theodore.
For the most part, the process of designing our home was exchanging 2D plans with their
draftsman. He would email us plans with some explanations and questions, and we'd mark them
up and send them back with our requests. I liked that I could spend as much time as I needed
with the floor plans before getting them back, but there were some parts about the design that
were hard to fully understand. It was easy to see where everything was and how it all fitted
together overall, but it was harder to imagine some of the details. Getting an idea of the size of
the spaces, how different finishes would all look together and how it would feel living in the
space were particularly challenging. Tim asked us for dimensions of our bulky pieces of
furniture e.g., couches, beds, fridge and dining table so he could insert them into his virtual tour
of our home, which was particularly helpful, as it gave us a very good idea cf how it was all
going to fit.
Peter and I know Tim through family, and he called me after a chat he had with our daughter,
Andrea. I'd been trying to wnrk out what finishes I wanted to choose for my kitchen and
bathrooms, and how much natural light would get in to brighten the space up. Andrea had
relayed a few of the challenges we had to Tirn, and he gave me a call salng he thought what he
was working on would help. He said there were a few things he wanted to test with his
innovation, and that he'd do it for free to get our feedback,
I sent through the files we'd been given from Westbuilt along with some of the things I'd saved
on Pinterest, and that was all he needed. He didn't tell us too much about what he'd be making
for us, but he asked a few questions about what I was finding difficult, and we didn't hear from
him for a few weeks.
I was familiar with the kind of work Tirn and his company had been doing over the years, but
when he delivered our virtual tour, it blew us both away. I'd been expecting it to be sornething
he'd take us through over Zoorn, Lrut one day he just texted me saying it was finished and shared
a link with us. There was nothing else we had to do; we just clicked on it, and we had it.
The virtual tour was exceptionally easy, we picked it up straight away. The visuals were
fantastic and being able to see the house, tioth inside and out, from any angle meant I wasn't
guessing how everything fitted together. Peter and I went through the whole hbuse and
discussed the different areas. This helped us spot and fix a few logistical flaws, and understand
how light and our finishes looked together, and get a feel for a few spaces we'd been concerned
about. Overall, though, what we saw virtually was just as we'd imagined our new home would
look like. By this stage we had all but finalised the design, and it was wonderful being able to
properly understand the whole thing.The virtual tour of our home was easy to navigate, informative and extremely enjoyable and we
spent a lot of time just goirlg through it, seeing how it all looked. We were excited to see and
walk through our home befcrre it was even built. By the time we actually did our final
walkthrough in Warwich it felt like home. Many of our friends and family members are spread
across Queensland, atld one of my favourite things about the virtual tour was that we could
show everyone our design and share our excitement.
CclnceptV's virtual tours have given us the ability to fully understand, connect and share our
design. I think their product has enormous potential to help peopte designing their home,
especially those like us who live away from major urban ceiltres. The fact that we could
correspond with Tim via phone and email made it all so much easier than having to travel to
Brisbane to meet with him and his team" That is a huge benefit for country people. We feel that
anyone designing a new home would benefit enormously by using ConceptV's virtual tours. We
had no idea that a virtual tour based on a 2D plan was a possibility for us. It is easy to use,
convenient and we hope they're able to bring the concept to more new home huilders,
particularly in the regional areas.
Kind regards,
Diana and Peter French

To whom  it may concern,  
I am a private investor  with experience across  some of the world ’s largest investment funds, 
including  recently as  part of Aware Super ’s Real Estate investment team , where I engaged in 
direct equity investment  and portfolio ma nagement of a multibillion -dollar  property  portfolio.  
I had the p leasure of investing in Con ceptV in April of this year , having  first become familiar 
with the Company in 2018 when it was in an early conceptual stage . I have been e xtremely 
impressed  with the progress Tim has made since this time , and the opportunity to partner with 
him as an investor and advisor has me exc ited for the future traje ctory of the Company.  As an 
advisor , I have been able to bring my wealth of institu tional invest ment, due diligence , and real 
estate sector knowledge to partner with ConceptV and provide T im with strategic guidance as 
the Company pursues its ambitious next stage of growth . 
The market for Prop Tech is significant and growing, an d my investment was based on a 
fundamenta l belief th at Concept V offers an enduring value prop osition to stakeholders across 
the property value chain . I have seen firsthand  as an institutional  investor how the construction 
and development  process is cumbersome , unwieldy,  and costly.  By disintermediating the 
design and construction process with its innovative  Virtual Tour  offering, Concept V has global 
potenti al to support a range of industry stakehol ders, including architects , developers , 
builders, occupants,  and investor s, to improve the effi ciency of the industry overall . 
ConceptV ’s commercialisation has proven promising since the time of my investm ent and has 
been based on a well-considered strategic approach to the management of organisational 
growth  and change . Tim has built an extensive network across not only the property industry , 
but has drawn on appr opriate legal , financial and techn ical support in order to execute on his 
strategy . I have been consiste ntly impressed with Tim ’s purposive approach with respect to  
scaling ConceptV and his prudent deployment of capital to support the operational expansion 
and improvement of a v ariety of internal functions . Among these include:  
• Sales  – in growing ConceptV ’s client base over the cou rse of 20 22 with reputable  and 
high-quality  counterparties  in line with the go -to-market strategy and service  rollou t; 
• Operations and deliverance  – in ensuring  personnel growth ha s been tailored  to 
support recognised and critical business needs ; and  
• Product and t echnology  – through  a focus on iterating and improving the Virtual Tour  
offering to generate both time and cost efficiencies internally whilst responding to end 
user demand and improving the product experience . 
In impl ementing the go-to-market strategy, Tim has consistently demonstrated willingness to 
take onboard feedba ck and pivot t o the most prospective and pressing requirements facing 
the Co mpany. In doing so, he has been able to drive the best outcomes for his clients, staff 
and investors, which will serve him well as the commercialisation phase  continues to ramp u p. 
I am excit ed by the potential for the Ignite Ideas Fund to accelerate the growth of ConceptV ’s 
commercialis ation . Today , Concept V services a range of resident ial property players whilst 
partly t apping into the commercial property market . I have seen first hand , working in 
conjunction with Australia ’s largest property players, including Lendlease, how  the Virtual Tour  
offering can  provide effic iency advantages across not only the residential, bu t also the office, 
retail, and industrial sector s. The ease of accessibility and configu rability related to the visual 
outputs it produces is unmatched in the mar ket, especially from a cost st andpoint , and its 
applications have the potential to dis rupt not only key elements of property design , but also 
extend to property and construction management and serve as a key tool for enhancing the 
occupan t experience and investor due diligence . Invest or Letter of Recomme ndation  28 August 2022  
A grant from t he Ignite Ideas F und will see Concept V able to accelerate it s current 
commercialisation and growth strategies  in order to serve these critical adjacen t markets in a 
much shorter timeframe than would otherwise be possible.  In doing so , the grant will enhance 
ConceptV ’s ability to promote future f unding rounds, in turn support ing more r apid innovation 
and the creation of sustainable high-tech jobs. Today, ConceptV is not a nebulous  idea on a 
page but a very real service  on the cusp of trans forming the property industry  if provided with 
the appropriate runway to support its growth . 
As a Queensland native, it is always encouraging to see homegrow n products and services 
with broad national and international applicability . ConceptV is ideally positioned to support 
not only the State’s booming construction industry over t he next decade , but global innovation 
across the property value chain . I continue to be excited by ConceptV ’s potential  and T im’s 
impressive capabilit ies as a founder and CEO in exe cuting on his vision  for the b etterm ent of 
one of  Queensland ’s, Australia ’s and the wor ld’s most important industries.

To the assessors of the Ignite Ideas grant,  
My wife and I commenced  the journey of designing our new home with a leading Queensland architect on 
our Scarborough property at the start of  2020. The house is highly personalised  requiring over 12 months 
of design investment in time and energy, partnering with several  professionals. Eventuall y we reached a 
point where my wife and I felt we had captured the true essence of the home and design details, so we  
approached ConceptV back in early 2021 after introductions from a mutual friend.  
 
Tim was testing new internal processes and offered an attra ctive proof of concept proposal for our new 
home  in exchange for feedback and permission to use the resulting work for  marketing  purposes . The 
concept was great, and I was very excited to see it once it came together.   
 
Our project was reasonably  complex w ith a sloping block, over four levels with a design  requiring a high 
degree  of engineering.  The architect, Chris Clout Design,  provided comprehensive  sets of floor plans, 
elevations, joinery designs, finish ing schedules and a few rendered images.  These along with other details 
from general discussions and site visits were passed on to Tim and his team.  
 
A few weeks later Tim call ed and sent me a text ink to w hat he called a “work in progress”. It appeared to 
be 95% complete to me. The reali sm, attention to detail and ability scan around in every direction brought 
the home to life. The solution require d no training, and by its very nature, is exceptionally intuit ive.   
 
We had invest ed 12 months  in the homes ’ design  with a leading Australian architect. I went through the 
virtual tour again on my phone at home.  I spent 90 minutes  with it and discovered 21 items requiring further 
attention via Tim’s solution . There are aspects that would be extremely difficult to identify if it wasn’t for 
taking a realistic and detailed walk -through of the home with the ability to view both interiors and exteriors 
from almost any p erspective.  As a result,  we felt much more co nfident about the design with the virtual tour. 
I could easily share with my friends and family to get their opinions, text the link and easily communicate to 
anyone at any time . 
 
The house is currently under construction by GRAYA. I passed the virtual tour to Pete r Richardson, the 
foreman, who uses it every  day on site. Having the tour on site with access for all key trades allow s 
everyone to visualise the result , understand the larger picture and prevent mistakes  or misunderstandings 
potentiall y resulting in additional costs .  
 
ConceptV’s platform is highly valuable,  and I  am actively recommend ing it to other building and design 
professionals .  
 
Having an interactive visualisation tool had a significant positive impact on our project, from making the 
right d esign decisions up front, to involving my friends and family , through to day-to-day management  
decisions  and effective cost management.  I believe they have a unique product that has incredible potential 
to succeed in the design and building sectors.

To whom it may concern, 
 
Reds Group are a commercial development company delivering community oriented spaces across 
Queensland.  
A projects design is the combined effort of architects, engineers, interior designers, lighting 
designers, landscape designers and many other moving parts all with a common goal: design a space 
fit for it’s purpose. With so many stakeholders involved, we experience significant difficulties that 
largely boil down to efficiency, and timeliness, of design communication. Everyone has their own IP, 
their own software and no one owns the whole thing. As a result, there’s a high level of risk for 
errors when it’s all brought together.  
When those errors are caught, there’s significant back and forth between revisions and reviews. 
When they’re not, they show up during construction or post completion – leading to re-work, late 
stage alterations or an end result that isn’t effectively designed for purpose. In any case, those 
design errors wind up costing large amounts in both time and money. 
Another difficulty we face during design is communicating design intent to the designers.  
“I want buildings that belong and look like they’ve been there for a long time. Having the view on 
how we want the facades to look, in context, at the earliest stages will save a great amount of time 
in policing what the architects are doing later on. Because it’s hard to manage what the architect 
think is the right method for designing a shop.” Jason Blair – Property Director of Reds Group 
We engaged Tim from ConceptV in November 2021 for a trial on one of our active projects in 
Everton Park. Tim was introduced by a business associate who had trialled ConceptV’s services and 
recommended we have a meeting. After explaining the difficulties we have, Tim provided us with a 
proposal for how his platform could help address those problems. We accepted Tim’s proposal for a 
6 weeks trial on our P6 project, which was in the work up phase at the time.  
ConceptV were provided with the requested files, and Tim was nominated as one of our project 
leads for the project. Tim was to be involved in fortnightly design discussions with the other project 
leads, updating the tour with new information, suggesting and developing tools based on feedback 
from the team.  
 
 
 
 
 In the 6 weeks after ConceptV’s platform was delivered, the team discovered: 
 a disparity of revisions between the architect, kitchen designer and bar design 
 an element of the kitchen design impeding communication flow amongst kitchen staff by the 
head chef 
 a kitchen rack with incorrect dimensions that would not fit in the space 
Since the trial ended, we contracted ConceptV to continue evolving the platform with design 
progress, and they are designing additional functions specifically built for our projects and process.  
The tour has been highly beneficial as a communication tools, especially among the many non-
technical stakeholders. Explaining the project in financial, legal and client meetings is much easier, 
and is far more comprehensible in a holistic sense than technical plans alone.  
We’re looking at this as a potential solution to the difficulties outlined above. With the 
understanding that the platform will evolve to fit new uses, we intend on utilising the virtual tour 
during the remainder of design, during construction, as part of our marketing and as a tool visitors of 
the development can use to find helpful information while there. From what we’ve experienced so 
far, the unique platform ConceptV have developed will likely fulfill it’s objective and go on to deliver 
further value in additional stages of the development process.  
We’ve already engaged ConceptV for another development in Redcliffe ( Reds Group - Redcliffe ) after 
discussing the advantages of using their platform from the very start of a project, allowing us to 
develop the concept design with respect to the surrounding environment. They later provided us a 
proposal with custom made tools, which we accepted.  
“One of the biggest costs in the business is building things when surrounding elements haven’t been 
considered properly. Often people can’t afford to rebuild, so have to learn to live with the mistakes, 
or mask them. The Digital Tour is making us think about the space as a whole, before we build it, 
avoiding mistakes and profit loss. That’s ultimately the value of the 3D model if compared to 
traditional methods.” Jason Blair – Property Director of Reds Group 
There have been teething problems during the process which was not unexpected, but overall the 
Tour provided by ConceptV has had a positive impact on our process and has helped identify design 
issues that would have been incredibly difficult otherwise. To date, we have not seen anything else 
like it in the market. It is a unique product that has the potential to bring significant time and cost 
savings to our business.  
“’Success’ for this partnership means that we're able to use the model all the time as we’re planning 
the venue, building it visually before incurring the construction cost. It’s also a matter of managing 
the input level from everyone - and making the model work.” Jason Blair 
After using it for the last 10 months, we’re impressed with the potential and have begun 
implementing it on other projects. We have 7 other active project which we intend on bringing 
ConceptV on board for.  
“The practical use of this platform has some incredible efficiencies, especially considering we tend to 
use the same team for multiple projects. I want to reduce the scope of the designers and get their 
input later rather than earlier, as their method of work is very rigid and hard to make changes 
without going out of the tender. From the business perspective, we need more time and certainty to 
assess viability before committing to a certain design. “ Jason Blair  We believe that ConceptVs unique innovation has considerable application in the property industry, 
and we look forward to continuing to work with them.

Re: Letter of Recommendation for Concept V  
 
 
 
To whom it may concern,  
 
 
Tim Geldard of ConceptV reached out to our team in late May this year  and, after discussing 
the possible applications for their virtual tour platform, decided to see how the platform could 
be integrated with our process with a free proof of concept.  (Reference tour: 
https://con ceptv.io/panotours/client/wala/thecrescent ) 
 
In our experience , our clients find it challenging  to understand their  building  design from 
technical drawings , especially if they have no prior construction knowledge or experience . This 
leads to our studio relying heavily on  visual aids to help communicate the design which results 
in inefficiencies and a longer time spent of projects .   
 
Recent years have seen a somewhat open -minded adoption of virtual reality among design 
studios in the AEC industry . VR was touted as the next big thing in the toolkit for architects 
building designers and developers. However,  we have obser ved that the use of VR is not a 
‘one-size-fits-all’ solution and hence VR adoption in the industry has been met with varied 
success. Based on feedback from clients and industry peers, the use of VR can be limited 
both as a physical design tool and as somet hing consumers  may be uncomfortable with (i.e. 
experiences of vertigo and/or dizziness when wearing a VR headset). In addition to VR, t here 
are other companies experimenting with innovations to help c onsumers  bridge the divide 
between pap er-architecture and final -build, such as ones  project ing 1:1 scale floorplans  that 
allow people  to do a quasi -real life walkthrough of the proposed architecture . But they too face 
limitations  – these methods do not successfully  capture  a true  sense of scale, light or colours.  
 
Both of the se tools/offerings are only able to leave an imp ression on our clients within a limited 
amount of time (1 -2hrs) due to the physical setup  of proprietary equipment in a fixed 
office/warehouse space. O ftentimes it’s hard for people to make the time during a work week  
to participate  and even if they do, they are only afforded  a small window of time to digest the 
visual information and subsequent decide , from memory,  what they want to do.   
 
Even if our practice  incorporates  VR into our design process , the barriers to adoption can be 
quite prohibitive for a small business  such as ours . The hardware can be expensive which 
means we’d have to change our process and spend more time on each project . Bigger studios 
can afford the extra cost, so we lose some jobs because bigger studios have more perceive d 
value.   
 
When we trialled ConceptV’s platform, it took far less effort than I expected. The whole process 
of getting it made took me less than 10 minutes  and they managed to create everything from 
files we alr eady had. I liked that we did not  need to go and get new hardware or go through a 
whole process of installing something new and learning how to use it. When we got it back, it 
just worked.   
  
 
 
 
 
W A L A   –   W E I A N   L I M   A R C H I T E C T S 
The platform Conce ptV developed is very intuitive; even our less tech -savvy client s will  be 
able to easily engage with the 3D model on their own personal devices very quickly.  The 3D 
model can be delivered  to our clients over Zoom, and with a QR code for them to scan  via 
their mobile phone s, they can have in in the palm of their hand ( literally ) straight away. Our 
clients need not take  time off work to understand their design  – they are able to access an 
easy -to-use interface at their own time and jump straight into the 3D model  with immediacy . 
They can go through it as often  as they want, think it through with friends and  family and 
ultimately make  more informed, concise decisions. I can see it being a significant help to many 
of my clients  as well as a helpful tool for our design team . 
 
ConceptV hav e built a lo t more into it than I’d thought and  it’s very versatile. 90% of our 
business c omes through word -of-mouth, and because our clients have it readily available on 
their phone, they’ll show it to their friends and family and our brand is right on top. We can 
host it on our website, so we can show prospective buyers the kind of experience  they could 
get with us and increase our perceived value to compete against the larger studios.  
 
Whilst w e haven’t had the chance to test it yet  with a live project,  I can see a big benefit for 
construction. There are man y sets of documentation on site  and it’s not uncommon that 
different people will have different revisions. It can be a struggle for contractors to keep on top 
of all the variations to  the technical drawings, so it’s up to the site supervisor to educate 
everyone and make sure everything goes  the way it’s supposed to. Having a central, accurate 
model that everyone can access and understand will go a long way to reducing mistakes, and 
likely save the clients quite a lot of money.  
 
I’m a big supporter of the platform. Compared with other availab le offerings, I believe this has 
the potential for mass -adoption across the industry due to its low barrier o f adoption, ease of 
use, and reasonable pricing which caters very well to smaller design studios looking at  
providing consumers with an excellent t ool/service that does not discriminate . I’m excited to 
offer this to my clients and see how it evolves.   
 
All things considered, the WALA team believes that ConceptV is offering a very interesting 
and useful solution to the architect ure industry.

ABN:  46 895 074 299   QLD Reg #: 4449   NSW Reg #: 8738.   Thursday 25th August, 2022.  Reference Tour: https://conceptv.io/panotours/desktop/client/habitatstudio/vespacrescent/index.php  To whom it may concern:  Dear Sir, Madam, I run a primarily boutique residential Architecture practice in Burleigh Heads. Tim contacted me in May 2022 and told me about his virtual tour platform. We had a few meetings to discuss the capabilities, and after he offered a free proof of concept we agreed. We chose one of our clients building on the Gold Coast who was moving up from Sydney as the project was significant, and communicating across the country during the process had been challenging.   Many of our clients struggle to understand technical drawings, and it can be difficult conveying our intent. Without understanding, they can’t make concise decisions and communicate to us what they want, so it tends to take us a lot more time. We spent a lot of time creating a 3D model to take the clients through in person, but there’s a lot to cover in a short amount of time and they can’t take it with them.   I see a lot of places adopting virtual reality in the industry, but it’s been met with mixed results. From my experience & perception of VR it is a relatively new technology to be adopted, even though the concept in gaming has been around for a while. For this reason I had only seen it implemented in large corporate firms with large scale multi residential, commercial or high rise projects. This lead to assumptions of high costs & quite clunky new technology being incorporated in programs with expensive VR proprietary goggle systems as it was being refined.   There are practical considerations as well for VR. The hardware is expensive, and it means we’d have to change our process and spend more time on each project which we just don’t have the time for. Even then, we’d still have the same time restrictions as we do now.  The trial we did with ConceptV was incredibly easy. They worked with our existing files, and other than a few annotations, there was nothing else we needed to do. When they delivered it, we just scanned a QR code with our phones and it was live.   Delivering the project to our clients was just as easy. Initially advising our clients of what was produced had them excited to start with & all we had to do was share a link & advise them of the basic functions & user guide if they got stuck. They could similarly just scan a QR code & save it to their home page for ease of showing it off to their friends & family. They loved the gyroscope function on their phones & it certainly couldn’t have been a simpler, hassle free transition to deliver the project & have them navigating & exploring in no time.

 They’ve made it really easy to work, even our older clients would be able to pick up by themselves. Because it’s so available, clients don’t need to take time off work to understand their design. They can go through it as much as they want, think it through with friends and family and ultimately make much more informed, concise decisions. I can see it being a significant help to many of my clients.  There’s a lot more to it than I originally thought. Finding our PDFs in the tour was very convenient, and we discovered a gyroscope mode on our phones that allowed us to move around as if we were there, similar to VR but without all the equipment. There’s even a system that allows users to make annotations around the tour, which would be very useful for our clients to communicate the changes they’d like with us.   Most of our business comes through word of mouth, and because our clients have it readily available on their phone, they’ll show it to their friends and family and our brand is right on top. We can host it on our website, so we can show prospective buyers the kind of experience they could get with us and increase our perceived value to compete against the larger studios.  We haven’t had the chance to test it yet, but I can see a big benefit for construction. There are many sets of documentation on site, and it’s not uncommon that different people will have different revisions. Most contractors can’t read technical plans either, so it’s up to the site supervisor to educate everyone and make sure everything goes the way it’s supposed to. Having a central, accurate model that everyone can access and understand will go a long way to reducing mistakes, and likely save the clients quite a lot of money.  I’m a big supporter of the platform. I haven’t come across anything so easy and multi-use in the industry. It’s easy to adopt, easy to provide and is reasonably priced. We’re currently assessing whether we include this as part of every project we do, or if we offer it for special cases.   ConceptV are bringing a very innovative product to the market. I for one am very excited to see it implement and grow, and I am a big supporter of the platform.    Yours Faithfully,       Wayne Greenland Principal Architect/Director Habitat Studio Architects.

Tim called me in May this year asking for my feedback on a new product he was bringing to 
market , and we’ve been keeping in touch since then. Recently, we were asked to provide a service 
proposal for a large development with very new design principles.  
We have recently submitted our services proposal for the design and implementation of a large 
comm unity centric peri -urban residential development and would like to engage the ConceptV 
team as part of this work. The first stage consists of 100 homes, scaling up to 2,000. We have 
placed a proposal with the developer in Victoria and are awaiting a respon se. 
The developers want to implement innovative design principles, steering away from the typical 
compact stock aimed at a particular demographic in favour of a community oriented, inclusive 
architecture with a strong focus on adaptable living and sustaina bility. To do so, they want 
exposure and create a large following.  
As part of the service proposal, we want to be able to communicate with the wider community to 
get feedback on design principles, and allow suggestions and feedback. We want to be able to 
funnel the audience in three tiers:  
1. Public - everyone in order to collect mass data on peoples preferences  
2. Interested parties - people that are genuinely interested in the concept and considering 
being a part of it  
3. Committed parties - people who have paid a  deposit and intend on living in the 
community once it’s completed  
Each of these stages will contribute differently, becoming more granular the further down the list. 
We want people to be able to actively contribute to the architecture of their community.   
We discussed our vision for the project, and Tim told me more about how his product works and 
what it can do. The opportunity exists not only for an innovative approach to a new way of living, 
but also in pathways to market and user oriented engagement an d empowerment to influence 
their own living environment.  
With ConceptV’s innovation, our service proposal enables:  
 A widely, immediately accessible model of the project through every medium of public 
contact  
 A simple, intuitive, comprehensive and engaging method showcasing key design principles 
to every demographic

 An easy way to collect feedback and preferences on innovative design principles from the 
masses  
 Demographic specific preferences   
 Warm leads and sales funnels  
 Removal of risk of misconception abo ut the design  
 The community to be actively involved in where they’re going to live  
 Market testing and value perception of new principles to de -risk the development  
With their technology, we  would  be able to curate economically viable design principles for 
suburban living through wide facing communication and feedback from the public.  The innovation 
that ConceptV are bringing to the market enables communication on a whole new scale. The 
capacity and potential of their platform is unique, and has the potential to bring enormous value to 
everyone involved in the design and construct of property.  
We would very much look forward to working with ConceptV on this project and others into the 
future .

RE: Recommendation Letter for ConceptV   
 
Tim called me in July this year after Michael Pikos from Pikos  Developments, gave him my number. Tim asked to meet with me 
and discuss my experience regarding off -the-plan sales for new developments.   
 
In my experience, clients find it challenging to fully understand spaces that haven’t been built yet. Trying to expl ain how the entry 
flows into the living space, or how pleasant the walk is from the swimming pool back to their home  can be incredibly challenging 
and subdue their value perception of the property.  
 
We’ve seen mixed results from trying other visualisat ion methods, such as providing more imagery, videos,  or virtual reality. Other 
than logistical integration challenges, these only painted a partial picture of the lifestyle we were trying to sell. Clients  were still 
unable to envision their potential life, and it’s difficult to guide them through the process when they’re not emotionally 
connected.  
 
Other interactive technologies are limited to when we see a client in person, at the office or display. Getting them there and  
keeping them engaged after they leave are completely different challenges. Once they go back home, they rely on memory to tal k 
it over with others and come to a purchase decision. As a result, there are often over 80 points of contact before a client bu ys an 
off-plan property.   
 
After seeing some examples and discussing possibilities with Tim, I think ConceptV can bring a unique so lution to this problem. 
Their platform is available everywhere, which opens the possibility to have effective consultations both inside and outside t he 
displays and reach potential buyers anywhere. It’s holistic and highly interactive, so we can tailor how  we show the development 
to different buyer profiles, and we’re able to dynamically respond to clients' questions and feedback during a meeting. All our 
existing sales and marketing material can be built into the tour, so we can find everything we need as we’re ‘walking’ through.   
 
One of the main things that impressed me was how multifunctional their products are. We can chop and change parts of the 
Virtual Tour and send it out, post it online, and integrate it with our brochures. We can generate images , link QR codes, and 
connect it to display screens. That gives us a variety of engaging material for clients in all stages, from prospecting and e nquiries 
to continuing sales motivation post -meeting and post -sale. This is the first product of its kind tha t I’ve come across, and I am 
looking forward to further exploring how it can benefit our sales process.  
 
I have arranged a trial with an active development we’ve been commissioned for in Taringa, Brisbane. I have not seen a produc t 
this versatile and dynam ic available in the industry, and I believe it will bring significant benefit to GAP Development Sales and 
companies like it.  
 
Kind Regards ,

I wanted to give my website visitors a tool that they could use to test different design and 
finish options, and configure a kit home that suits their needs. We’ve been in touch with ConceptV since they started in 2019 and have given them feedback on their product as it 
evolved. 
 
 
Since Covid, we see lot more online purchases of our kits, and we want to capitalise on that 
momentum. We had a quoting system made for it, but customers still couldn’t see what the options they’d chosen actually looked like. I was talking to Tim about this at the start of 2022, 
and when he told me his platform could now generate exactly what we needed, we agreed to 
do a discounted initial trial. 
 
 They delivered it to us a few months later, fully configured to connect with our new quoting system and doing exactly what we wanted. 
 
 
The selector ConceptV developed for us shows an instant visual and pricing update on the 
different variables we offer. We operate in quite a few countries, and now customers can just go to our website, choose a plan, select their configuration and instantly see what it looks like and what it costs. We’re looking at this as a way to create a new revenue stream, completely automated sales from the website. 
 
 
This tool is a much-needed solution for our sales processes. Since COVID-19 started, 
people want to see and do more activities online. This includes the freedom of planning their design without relying on a consultant, in their own time. Our selector can reach people anywhere, anytime. It’s very easy to use, and there’s nothing like it out there, which gives us 
a unique advantage over our competition. 
 
ConcepV’s unique product has changed how much we can achieve with the business. 
Having a completely interactive viewer that’s linked up to our quoting system is a game changer. People from all over the world can go to our website, choose and configure one of our kits and buy it. We’ve already ordered another 8, and we’re aiming to update all our designs over time.

Re: Concept V Reference.  
 
I met ConceptV  in February 2022, at the Independent Builders Network conference in 
Bendigo. They were showing their product, and we talked a bit about it. Since then, I’ve 
kept in touch with Tim and we’ve recently engaged them.   
 
There’s usually 3 main ways to capture b usiness as a builder: referrals, marketing and 
displays. I’ve seen an increased use of Matterport tours on other builder’s webpages 
since Covid, which is great to allow people to see the homes in full capacity. We’ve got 
hundreds of plans that we offer to our customers which we’re constantly adding to and 
it’s not feasible for us to get Matterport tours for our plans. We’d need to build a lot of 
displays, or make them once we finish a client home, but they’re almost always custom, 
not furnished and have a v ery long lead time.   
 
We offer hundreds of plans as well as bespoke plans to our clients. A lot of our clients 
struggle to understand what their home is going to look like from floor plans and colour 
swatches, which can lead to a lot of indecision and vari ation requests.   
 
I’ve seen a few of the big builders using virtual reality or big screens in their displays, 
but without the resources, the reach and the time they have it’s not something we can 
feasibly do. At the moment, we also don’t have a display hom e.  
 
Until I met Tim and Jackie from ConceptV, there wasn’t really anything available other 
than facade renders, colour swatches and floor plans to market our plans and guide our 
clients through design.

The product ConceptV  are bringing to market gives us new ways to compete against 
larger builders. It means we can have virtual display homes we can host anywhere, 
putting our sales people on equal footing with the larger builders. Further, their product 
is capable of showing multiple different options inside the virtual tour, meaning we can 
easily show customers the different options available to them for each design.  
 
We engaged ConceptV in July with a discount to create five virtual tours of new designs 
we’re bringing to mar ket. We’re looking at it as a trial to see how we can utilise the 
technology in the business. We’ll be using it initially in three areas: digital marketing 
campaigns, on the website and in person with our sales team.  
 
We can use their product in multiple d ifferent parts of the business, we gain a 
competitive advantage and it’s something we can feasibly afford. There are many more 
ways we can upgrade the tours for new purposes, and I’m looking forward to testing it 
in our business and seeing how it evolves.   
 
We are happy to recommend ConceptV for the Ignite Ideas fund, as they’re bringing a 
unique set of tools for the home building industry.

Alkot Studio -  Barbara Albert  
Reference tour : https://conceptv.io/panotours/client/alkotstudio/conceptplan  
 
ConceptV is an innovative young company with a set of interesting solutions for interior 
designers. We were recommended to ConceptV by one of our clients, and after meeting with 
them and discussing the possibilities, they offered us a free proof of concept.  
 
Creating a design for a client takes a lot of back and forth, and we often run into problems 
where a client doesn’t fully comprehend what we’re proposing. In those situations, it can get 
difficult and time consuming to communicate our design and get useful responses.  
 
Our design process has mostly revolved around 2D  images we capture from Sketchup and 
reference images for the mood and style we’re envisioning. It works, but we can’t fully 
express and get feedback on what the intent is as we’re limited to what’s available and 
affordable.  
 
With ConceptV’s virtual tours  proposals should be much easier, especially for clients who 
aren’t very good at visualising. Their platform works with all the software we use, and the 
fact it’s readily available should make it much easier delivering proposals. We’re able to build 
in information panels inside the tour, so anything we need to explain or point out to the client 
is right there for them to see.  
 
We can also use tours of our projects to boost our marketing. Having this up on our website 
or sending one over to a potential clie nt gives us a strong point of difference and could easily 
generate new business.  
 
The proof of concept was a great exercise to test how we work together, and how we can 
improve the end result. Since we’ve received the tour, we’ve had a couple of feedback 
sessions to discuss   some redesign areas, learn about new tools and also to plan for more 
efficient future collaboration. 
 
From a pricing perspective, the prices we’ve been given are affordable and tailored to each 
project. By using ConceptV, we can reduce a lot of the non-design work we currently do in 
house.  
 
We’ll be using an updated version of this tour in our portfolio and on our website, to show the 
idea to other clients and attract more high-end business. We are working towards building 
the cost of t he virtual tours into our fees, as an optional project delivery option. We believe 
that future clients will be excited to see their projects come to life with an interactive model, 
and that many will pay the extra cost for it.  
 
ConceptV is bringing a much needed change to how design projects can be presented and 
shared between professionals and clients. We support their application for the Ignite Ideas 
Fund.

campaigns, on the website and in person with our sales team.  
 
We can use their product in multiple d ifferent parts of the business, we gain a 
competitive advantage and it’s something we can feasibly afford. There are many more 
ways we can upgrade the tours for new purposes, and I’m looking forward to testing it 
in our business and seeing how it evolves.   
 
We are happy to recommend ConceptV for the Ignite Ideas fund, as they’re bringing a 
unique set of tools for the home building industry.  
 
 
 
Your Faithfully,

# Client Testimonials (4)

Don’t take our word for it!
Architects & Interior Designers
“Having this kind of centralised system really helps when coordinating projects with engineers. ”
Steven Bishop  -  Director at SJ Bishop Architects“Utilising the platform from ConceptV was incredibly easy. It took our design ideas & brought our 3D renders to life to 
communicate with the clients. It was great for the clients to have a user friendly platform they had ownership of to show to 
their own friends & family. ”
Wayne Greenland  -  Director  -
“ConceptV has the potential to be a game-changing innovation in the way architects and building designers can further 
client engagement. Developing an intuitive and interactive tool, that puts the design quite literally in the palm of our clients’ 
hands, immediately elevates their level of involvement and input to make the project experience a truly collaborative 
endeavour. ”
Weian Lim  -  Director  -
“I was very impressed with the quality and level of detail produced in the ConceptV presentation, as were my clients. 
Looking forward to using it on my next project. ”
Demis Roussos  -  Director  -
“We’ve used other visualisation software before such as Enscape but ConceptV’s product is much easier to produce and 
far more effective.”
Evan Pickering  -  Director  -
“The innovation that ConceptV are bringing to the market enables communication on a whole new scale. With their 
technology, we would be able to curate economically viable design principles for suburban living through wide facing 
communication and feedback from the public. ”
Andrew Milward-Bason  -  Director  -
“Creating a design for a client takes a lot of back and forth, and we often run into problems where a client doesn’t fully 
comprehend what we’re proposing. ConceptV is bringing a much needed change to how design projects can be presented 
and shared between professionals and clients.”
Barbara Albert  -  Director  -“People are really able to understand and tangibly see what they’re getting. ”
Eloisa Greenham  -  Marketing Manager  -Home Builders
“ConceptV’s Virtual Tour allowed my clients to make a detailed list of changes in a single round. My design process has 
been streamlined from the reduced variation requests.”
Mat Dagg  -  New Home Consultant  -
“This tool is a much-needed solution for our sales processes. Since COVID-19 started, people want to see and do more 
activities online. This includes the freedom of planning their design without relying on a consultant, in their own time. Our 
selector can reach people anywhere, anytime. It’s very easy to use, and there’s nothing like it out there. ”
Keith Richardson  -  General Manager  -
“The product ConceptV is bringing to market gives us new ways to compete against larger builders. It means we can 
have virtual display homes we can host anywhere, putting our sales people on equal footing with the larger builders. 
Further, their product is capable of showing multiple different options inside the virtual tour, meaning we can easily show 
customers the options available to them for each design. ”
Luke Shephard  -  Director  -“During the construction phase, interpreting plans and renders can be quite challenging. With ConceptV, the intuitive 3D 
model of the Seachange project has brought to life what our client has envisioned for their home, making complex design 
decisions easier onsite, saving money and time. ”
Pete Richardson  -  Site Supervisor  - 
Property Developers & Sales Specialists
“One of the main things that impressed me was how multifunctional their products are. We can chop and change parts of 
the Virtual Tour and send it out, post it online, and integrate it with our brochures. We can generate images, link QR codes, 
and connect it to display screens. That gives us a variety of engaging material for clients in all stages.”
Grant Plummer  -  Director  -“The Virtual Tour is making us think about the space as a whole, before we build it, avoiding mistakes and profit loss. 
That’s ultimately the value of the 3D model if compared to traditional methods. ”

“It’s a fantastic tool and so easy to use. It has provided us with a unique perspective on how our new house will look. ”
Nick F.  -  New home buyer  -  QLD“If we had a Virtual Tour available in the early stages of our planning process, our queries could have been covered over the 
course of one or two meetings, saving us the several backs-and-forwards during the planning process. ”
Diana & Peter French  -  New home buyers  -  QLD
“We already had the BIMx model that we were using but ConceptV’s Virtual Tour was more detailed and realistic. 
Thoroughly enjoyed using the program. ”
Alan & Skye H.  -  Architect clients  -  QLD
“I have seen firsthand as an institutional investor how the construction and development process is cumbersome, unwieldy, and costly. By disintermediating the design and construction process with its innovative Virtual Tour offering, ConceptV 
has global potential to support a range of industry stakeholders, including architects, developers, builders, occupants, and investors, to improve the efficiency of the industry overall. ”
 Sean McBurnie  -  Investor and Advisor at ConceptV Investors & Advisors
“Having an interactive visualisation tool had a significant positive impact on our project, from making the right design 
decisions up front, to involving my friends and family, through to day-to-day management decisions and effective cost

# Competitor Meeting Notes

﻿Competitor Notes
SpecifierLab


Call with Ben Powell - 18/05/22


They offer 2 different types of services
* A publishing software, which is like a sandbox tool for users to manipulate files exported from Revit, Archicad, etc. This is essentially free for members of their network and they don’t really make money from it.
* Enterprise solutions - these are custom tools and solutions developed to meet the needs of their biggest clients. This is where the money comes from. 


Check their iDesign by CSR, these are visualisers with custom preset styles and filters developed for their clients. Examples: https://visualiser.gyprock.com.au/gyprock and  https://monier.csridesign.com.au/56da71dd-53e6-403d-bf27-ffdc4646bf57.


This software has been in the making for several years, with the oldest client being with the company for 8 years.


Their focus is to establish a network of builders, designers, suppliers, etc. They’ve signed some pretty big companies and get/distribute a lot of work based on referrals. Their goal is to form long-term relationships.


Their finishes and surfaces are from real Australian suppliers, like Coco Republic, Cemintel and Monier. 


They don’t do any modelling or client work in house - if a client needs someone to manipulate their software, they’ll refer them to someone on the network.


Ben mentioned a few times they don’t use any gaming engines, so it’s all render tech (which he described as more powerful and realistic).


When using the software, the user can assign finishes to all surfaces (it reads labels from the cad list and automatically selects different surfaces). The user can also select which surfaces will be “dynamic” - so the end user can change finishes. That might be the roof, the walls, cornice, etc.


The user can also control lighting, apply filters to the scene and furnish the rooms.


The software looks sophisticated, is easy to use and has a decent library. 


It takes about 8 minutes to “dress up” a house with basic surroundings (external only).


If the architect needs to change the file (such as change kitchen layout or move a wall), the software will save the details and update the work, so the user doesn’t need to start from scratch.


The user cannot change the background, but it’s possible to export the renders and orbits with transparent background for photoshop post-production.


There’s no limit to file size, he showed me an example of the Melbourne CBD uploaded to the software.


Files uploaded to the software are all cloud-based. Users can export their work as standard links or APIs. 


They also have an Analytics portal.


They don’t do interactive tours, but the user can export “orbits”, which are essentially 360 renders. To move from one room to another you go to the next image.


Ben admitted that this might not be the best option for one-off projects. Better for project homes, where there are 100’s of designs and combinations of finishes to be exported.


We’re not exactly competing on the same market, but they have a great advantage when it comes to larger developments and some of our long-term target markets. Similar solutions to what we envisioned for our Switch platform.

Lucid Vue


Call with Brooke Smith - 23/05/22


Similar process to ours, in which they get the 3D files and go from there. They have the ability to do modelling in house, but the more 3D supplied, the cheaper the project.


To quote for a project, they receive and analyse the files to assess the amount of work, discuss requirements, then aim to send a quote back in 24h. There are no hidden costs.


Pricing ballpark was around 15k for a 2 bed apartment and up to 17k for a 3 bed apartment. That’s for a fully interactive tour, but without any custom functions, such as colour change. 


A full house costs a bit more, but usually stays under 20k.


Their clients with bigger developments will hardly model more than 2-3 units. Common areas (like an entry hall, entertaining room, bbq area) vary in price, usually from 5-10k each. She estimated the average pool area with some lounges and landscaping will cost around 5-7k.


They have 2 interior designers that can plan for the whole interior design, from scratch, or take their own direction with the project after a discussion on what we’re aiming for, target demographics, etc. They usually charge a “a few grand”  for the interior design service, but she reassured it’s not too expensive.


Delivery times range from 4-6 weeks for the average full project. Most projects are delivered within 4 weeks.


The Niseko project took 6 months, as the clients loved the tech and kept adding rooms to the scope. https://lucidvue.com/case-studies/niseko-virtual-tour/


Variations are not included, but usually cost between $350 - 550 each. They can also package those depending on the project requirements.


Virtual Tours are delivered as links/source code, so it can be texted or embedded on websites. There are no hosting fees, and tours can be hosted for an unlimited time.


Virtual Tours are compatible with any internet-connected device.


They also do rendering in-house, usually 1.5k-2k for an interior image, and around 3k for an external image. These get creeper if they do the Virtual Tour first.


They also have a tour specifically for architects with one-off projects. This is what they call a “white box” tour: rooms are not furnished and the finishes/lighting aren’t as sophisticated. It is essentially a lower resolution version, as architects and their clients are mostly interested in the overall spaces. 


They can quote more detailed areas separately, such as kitchen and bathrooms, depending on the client's interest.


This bare-bones tour usually costs around 3-5k.


Their whole tour interface was designed to be easy to navigate for the older population (around 60-80yo). Lifestyle communities are a big part of what they do.


They can work on custom tour features if required.


They’re targeting the same markets as our short and long term plans, but seem to have a solid client base and a fair number of enquiries. All the work is done in house.


They’ve been getting really good feedback and engagement from real estate agents. They usually text the client the tour link. No mention of QR codes.

Snaploader


Call with Eric Fink - 24/05/22


Most of their clients are property developers, but they also welcome private residential work.
Their client base is in Australia, US and UK.


They've been doubling their team every 6 months, enquiries are out of control, with a lot of repeat clients. Production capacity doesn’t seem to be a problem, but projects have to be booked in advance.


Not much of a cost difference if we give them 2D plans or 3D files. This is because they need to redo the whole model in their own system in order to simplify the plans. This process is similar to tracing.


Interestingly, they need to do a fly-through first to be able to generate a 360 tour. He called them Step 1 and Step 2, as they’d need to create the 360 scenes for the video, so adding the tour from there becomes quite cheap.


Delivery timeframes for the average development project is 6 weeks. Around 4 weeks if it’s just a single house.


They don’t factor design modifications in their process. Any redesign requests have to be quoted individually after the 3D model is delivered - it depends on how many hours it will take them to modify it.


They don’t have the ability to do any CGI in-house. What they do is create a gallery inside the tour using renders/collateral they get from the developer’s marketing team.


They also don’t take 360 drone shots for the surroundings. They have guidelines to provide to clients, or a guy that he can recommend in QLD.


Eric also said that a lot of people start small (like 1 floor or 1 apartment), end up loving the technology and come back for more. They seem to have a lot of return clients, including Allhomes (owned by Domain). 


They prioritise showcasing the whole development with every apartment floorplan over high-quality graphics. Completely different approach to Lucid Vue.


Their clients are getting very positive feedback from home buyers - they find it logical to follow, and get more clarity on how the buildings flow/look like.


The visuals are definitely not the greatest, but pricing is competitive and they make up for it with some of the functions and sales tools. They prepare nice proposals with images and descriptions instead of handing out quotes.


        



They have a few tools designed specifically for pre-sales, which includes their own version of a markup tool and analytics portal. They have developed an app for sales agents, which can be offered in conjunction with a tablet. They charge extra for installation and training.


They have the ability to update sale status (sold/available) live for their floorplan tours. That creates urgency and clients can actually see which units are still available.


Snaploader’s CEO is also behind Archistar. They capture developers early - at the stage of finding suitable sites - then offer them the sales package when the design is done.

# Diana _ Peter French (End Clients)

To whom it may concern,
My name is Diana French, my husband Peter and I are retired cotton farmers in Theodore,
Queensland. Our son and his wife will be moving into our old house and have taken over the
running of the farm.
2 years ago, Peter and I started designing a new home for ourselves. We approached Westbuilt
Homes, one of the few modular home builders that transport homes so far out. The house was
finished a month ago, and we're now settling in.
The prccess of designing was straight forward, but difficult. We met with the Westbuiit Homes
team in person three times, once for the initial briefing, once for colour selection, and eince for a
final walkthrough. Westbuilt Homes are based in Warwich which is a 5 hour drive each way
from Theodore.
For the most part, the process of designing our home was exchanging 2D plans with their
draftsman. He would email us plans with some explanations and questions, and we'd mark them
up and send them back with our requests. I liked that I could spend as much time as I needed
with the floor plans before getting them back, but there were some parts about the design that
were hard to fully understand. It was easy to see where everything was and how it all fitted
together overall, but it was harder to imagine some of the details. Getting an idea of the size of
the spaces, how different finishes would all look together and how it would feel living in the
space were particularly challenging. Tim asked us for dimensions of our bulky pieces of
furniture e.g., couches, beds, fridge and dining table so he could insert them into his virtual tour
of our home, which was particularly helpful, as it gave us a very good idea cf how it was all
going to fit.
Peter and I know Tim through family, and he called me after a chat he had with our daughter,
Andrea. I'd been trying to wnrk out what finishes I wanted to choose for my kitchen and
bathrooms, and how much natural light would get in to brighten the space up. Andrea had
relayed a few of the challenges we had to Tirn, and he gave me a call salng he thought what he
was working on would help. He said there were a few things he wanted to test with his
innovation, and that he'd do it for free to get our feedback,
I sent through the files we'd been given from Westbuilt along with some of the things I'd saved
on Pinterest, and that was all he needed. He didn't tell us too much about what he'd be making
for us, but he asked a few questions about what I was finding difficult, and we didn't hear from
him for a few weeks.
I was familiar with the kind of work Tirn and his company had been doing over the years, but
when he delivered our virtual tour, it blew us both away. I'd been expecting it to be sornething
he'd take us through over Zoorn, Lrut one day he just texted me saying it was finished and shared
a link with us. There was nothing else we had to do; we just clicked on it, and we had it.
The virtual tour was exceptionally easy, we picked it up straight away. The visuals were
fantastic and being able to see the house, tioth inside and out, from any angle meant I wasn't
guessing how everything fitted together. Peter and I went through the whole hbuse and
discussed the different areas. This helped us spot and fix a few logistical flaws, and understand
how light and our finishes looked together, and get a feel for a few spaces we'd been concerned
about. Overall, though, what we saw virtually was just as we'd imagined our new home would
look like. By this stage we had all but finalised the design, and it was wonderful being able to
properly understand the whole thing.The virtual tour of our home was easy to navigate, informative and extremely enjoyable and we
spent a lot of time just goirlg through it, seeing how it all looked. We were excited to see and
walk through our home befcrre it was even built. By the time we actually did our final
walkthrough in Warwich it felt like home. Many of our friends and family members are spread
across Queensland, atld one of my favourite things about the virtual tour was that we could
show everyone our design and share our excitement.
CclnceptV's virtual tours have given us the ability to fully understand, connect and share our
design. I think their product has enormous potential to help peopte designing their home,
especially those like us who live away from major urban ceiltres. The fact that we could
correspond with Tim via phone and email made it all so much easier than having to travel to
Brisbane to meet with him and his team" That is a huge benefit for country people. We feel that
anyone designing a new home would benefit enormously by using ConceptV's virtual tours. We
had no idea that a virtual tour based on a 2D plan was a possibility for us. It is easy to use,
convenient and we hope they're able to bring the concept to more new home huilders,
particularly in the regional areas.
Kind regards,
Diana and Peter French

# GAP (Development Sales)

To whom it may concern , 
 
RE: Recommendation Letter for ConceptV   
 
Tim called me in July this year after Michael Pikos from Pikos  Developments, gave him my number. Tim asked to meet with me 
and discuss my experience regarding off -the-plan sales for new developments.   
 
In my experience, clients find it challenging to fully understand spaces that haven’t been built yet. Trying to expl ain how the entry 
flows into the living space, or how pleasant the walk is from the swimming pool back to their home  can be incredibly challenging 
and subdue their value perception of the property.  
 
We’ve seen mixed results from trying other visualisat ion methods, such as providing more imagery, videos,  or virtual reality. Other 
than logistical integration challenges, these only painted a partial picture of the lifestyle we were trying to sell. Clients  were still 
unable to envision their potential life, and it’s difficult to guide them through the process when they’re not emotionally 
connected.  
 
Other interactive technologies are limited to when we see a client in person, at the office or display. Getting them there and  
keeping them engaged after they leave are completely different challenges. Once they go back home, they rely on memory to tal k 
it over with others and come to a purchase decision. As a result, there are often over 80 points of contact before a client bu ys an 
off-plan property.   
 
After seeing some examples and discussing possibilities with Tim, I think ConceptV can bring a unique so lution to this problem. 
Their platform is available everywhere, which opens the possibility to have effective consultations both inside and outside t he 
displays and reach potential buyers anywhere. It’s holistic and highly interactive, so we can tailor how  we show the development 
to different buyer profiles, and we’re able to dynamically respond to clients' questions and feedback during a meeting. All our 
existing sales and marketing material can be built into the tour, so we can find everything we need as we’re ‘walking’ through.   
 
One of the main things that impressed me was how multifunctional their products are. We can chop and change parts of the 
Virtual Tour and send it out, post it online, and integrate it with our brochures. We can generate images , link QR codes, and 
connect it to display screens. That gives us a variety of engaging material for clients in all stages, from prospecting and e nquiries 
to continuing sales motivation post -meeting and post -sale. This is the first product of its kind tha t I’ve come across, and I am 
looking forward to further exploring how it can benefit our sales process.  
 
I have arranged a trial with an active development we’ve been commissioned for in Taringa, Brisbane. I have not seen a produc t 
this versatile and dynam ic available in the industry, and I believe it will bring significant benefit to GAP Development Sales and 
companies like it.  
 
Kind Regards ,

ABN:  46 895 074 299   QLD Reg #: 4449   NSW Reg #: 8738.   Thursday 25th August, 2022.  Reference Tour: https://conceptv.io/panotours/desktop/client/habitatstudio/vespacrescent/index.php  To whom it may concern:  Dear Sir, Madam, I run a primarily boutique residential Architecture practice in Burleigh Heads. Tim contacted me in May 2022 and told me about his virtual tour platform. We had a few meetings to discuss the capabilities, and after he offered a free proof of concept we agreed. We chose one of our clients building on the Gold Coast who was moving up from Sydney as the project was significant, and communicating across the country during the process had been challenging.   Many of our clients struggle to understand technical drawings, and it can be difficult conveying our intent. Without understanding, they can’t make concise decisions and communicate to us what they want, so it tends to take us a lot more time. We spent a lot of time creating a 3D model to take the clients through in person, but there’s a lot to cover in a short amount of time and they can’t take it with them.   I see a lot of places adopting virtual reality in the industry, but it’s been met with mixed results. From my experience & perception of VR it is a relatively new technology to be adopted, even though the concept in gaming has been around for a while. For this reason I had only seen it implemented in large corporate firms with large scale multi residential, commercial or high rise projects. This lead to assumptions of high costs & quite clunky new technology being incorporated in programs with expensive VR proprietary goggle systems as it was being refined.   There are practical considerations as well for VR. The hardware is expensive, and it means we’d have to change our process and spend more time on each project which we just don’t have the time for. Even then, we’d still have the same time restrictions as we do now.  The trial we did with ConceptV was incredibly easy. They worked with our existing files, and other than a few annotations, there was nothing else we needed to do. When they delivered it, we just scanned a QR code with our phones and it was live.   Delivering the project to our clients was just as easy. Initially advising our clients of what was produced had them excited to start with & all we had to do was share a link & advise them of the basic functions & user guide if they got stuck. They could similarly just scan a QR code & save it to their home page for ease of showing it off to their friends & family. They loved the gyroscope function on their phones & it certainly couldn’t have been a simpler, hassle free transition to deliver the project & have them navigating & exploring in no time.     H  a  b  i  t  a  t     S  t  u  d  i  o     A  r  c  h  i  t  e  c  t  s     P  t  y     L  t  d . PO Box 340, Burleigh Heads, Qld, 4220. info@habitatarch.com.au                    ph: (07) 56 411622                                           www.habitatarch.com.au  
                     H  a  b  i  t  a  t     S  t  u  d  i  o     A  r  c  h  i  t  e  c  t  s     P  t  y     L  t  d .                                  ABN:  46 895 074 299   QLD Reg #: 4449   NSW Reg #: 8738.  
 They’ve made it really easy to work, even our older clients would be able to pick up by themselves. Because it’s so available, clients don’t need to take time off work to understand their design. They can go through it as much as they want, think it through with friends and family and ultimately make much more informed, concise decisions. I can see it being a significant help to many of my clients.  There’s a lot more to it than I originally thought. Finding our PDFs in the tour was very convenient, and we discovered a gyroscope mode on our phones that allowed us to move around as if we were there, similar to VR but without all the equipment. There’s even a system that allows users to make annotations around the tour, which would be very useful for our clients to communicate the changes they’d like with us.   Most of our business comes through word of mouth, and because our clients have it readily available on their phone, they’ll show it to their friends and family and our brand is right on top. We can host it on our website, so we can show prospective buyers the kind of experience they could get with us and increase our perceived value to compete against the larger studios.  We haven’t had the chance to test it yet, but I can see a big benefit for construction. There are many sets of documentation on site, and it’s not uncommon that different people will have different revisions. Most contractors can’t read technical plans either, so it’s up to the site supervisor to educate everyone and make sure everything goes the way it’s supposed to. Having a central, accurate model that everyone can access and understand will go a long way to reducing mistakes, and likely save the clients quite a lot of money.  I’m a big supporter of the platform. I haven’t come across anything so easy and multi-use in the industry. It’s easy to adopt, easy to provide and is reasonably priced. We’re currently assessing whether we include this as part of every project we do, or if we offer it for special cases.   ConceptV are bringing a very innovative product to the market. I for one am very excited to see it implement and grow, and I am a big supporter of the platform.    Yours Faithfully,       Wayne Greenland Principal Architect/Director Habitat Studio Architects.

To whom it may concern, 
Reference tour:  https://imaginekithomes.com.au/plans/eco-box-3/  
 
I wanted to give my website visitors a tool that they could use to test different design and 
finish options, and configure a kit home that suits their needs. We’ve been in touch with ConceptV since they started in 2019 and have given them feedback on their product as it 
evolved. 
 
 
Since Covid, we see lot more online purchases of our kits, and we want to capitalise on that 
momentum. We had a quoting system made for it, but customers still couldn’t see what the options they’d chosen actually looked like. I was talking to Tim about this at the start of 2022, 
and when he told me his platform could now generate exactly what we needed, we agreed to 
do a discounted initial trial. 
 
 They delivered it to us a few months later, fully configured to connect with our new quoting system and doing exactly what we wanted. 
 
 
The selector ConceptV developed for us shows an instant visual and pricing update on the 
different variables we offer. We operate in quite a few countries, and now customers can just go to our website, choose a plan, select their configuration and instantly see what it looks like and what it costs. We’re looking at this as a way to create a new revenue stream, completely automated sales from the website. 
 
 
This tool is a much-needed solution for our sales processes. Since COVID-19 started, 
people want to see and do more activities online. This includes the freedom of planning their design without relying on a consultant, in their own time. Our selector can reach people anywhere, anytime. It’s very easy to use, and there’s nothing like it out there, which gives us 
a unique advantage over our competition. 
 
ConcepV’s unique product has changed how much we can achieve with the business. 
Having a completely interactive viewer that’s linked up to our quoting system is a game changer. People from all over the world can go to our website, choose and configure one of our kits and buy it. We’ve already ordered another 8, and we’re aiming to update all our designs over time.

# Lindsay Birley (Advisor)

24th August 2022  
 
Reference tour:  https://conceptv.io/panotours/client/conceptv/seachange/  
 
To the assessors of the Ignite Ideas grant,  
My wife and I commenced  the journey of designing our new home with a leading Queensland architect on 
our Scarborough property at the start of  2020. The house is highly personalised  requiring over 12 months 
of design investment in time and energy, partnering with several  professionals. Eventuall y we reached a 
point where my wife and I felt we had captured the true essence of the home and design details, so we  
approached ConceptV back in early 2021 after introductions from a mutual friend.  
 
Tim was testing new internal processes and offered an attra ctive proof of concept proposal for our new 
home  in exchange for feedback and permission to use the resulting work for  marketing  purposes . The 
concept was great, and I was very excited to see it once it came together.   
 
Our project was reasonably  complex w ith a sloping block, over four levels with a design  requiring a high 
degree  of engineering.  The architect, Chris Clout Design,  provided comprehensive  sets of floor plans, 
elevations, joinery designs, finish ing schedules and a few rendered images.  These along with other details 
from general discussions and site visits were passed on to Tim and his team.  
 
A few weeks later Tim call ed and sent me a text ink to w hat he called a “work in progress”. It appeared to 
be 95% complete to me. The reali sm, attention to detail and ability scan around in every direction brought 
the home to life. The solution require d no training, and by its very nature, is exceptionally intuit ive.   
 
We had invest ed 12 months  in the homes ’ design  with a leading Australian architect. I went through the 
virtual tour again on my phone at home.  I spent 90 minutes  with it and discovered 21 items requiring further 
attention via Tim’s solution . There are aspects that would be extremely difficult to identify if it wasn’t for 
taking a realistic and detailed walk -through of the home with the ability to view both interiors and exteriors 
from almost any p erspective.  As a result,  we felt much more co nfident about the design with the virtual tour. 
I could easily share with my friends and family to get their opinions, text the link and easily communicate to 
anyone at any time . 
 
The house is currently under construction by GRAYA. I passed the virtual tour to Pete r Richardson, the 
foreman, who uses it every  day on site. Having the tour on site with access for all key trades allow s 
everyone to visualise the result , understand the larger picture and prevent mistakes  or misunderstandings 
potentiall y resulting in additional costs .  
 
ConceptV’s platform is highly valuable,  and I  am actively recommend ing it to other building and design 
professionals .  
 
Having an interactive visualisation tool had a significant positive impact on our project, from making the 
right d esign decisions up front, to involving my friends and family , through to day-to-day management  
decisions  and effective cost management.  I believe they have a unique product that has incredible potential 
to succeed in the design and building sectors.  
 
 
Your  sincerely ,

# Notes to self on Lindsay Loan

﻿Notes to self on Lindsay (current investor who Tim is requisition money) on Bridging Finance (9th may 2023):


Post-quoting, assign Liam to introduce the Swapper system and prepare the nucleus for operation. Request Jordy's update on script completion. Instruct Jay to categorize furniture and furniture types relevant to architecture, design, and development industries, and compile briefs for different categories in order to outsource collection. Document the preparation process for furniture and material assets for the nuclear server. 


Direct Michael to draft a list of key automations for the skin and tour, and establish an upload setup for adjustments. Also, task Michael to include a cache-clearing refresh button at the top left of every tour. 


Commission Liam to explore deep search implementation for firm creation and draft a proposal. Instruct Jackie to compile the Angela quote. Assign Liam to resume the Omniverse development partner initiative and work on overlay custom code. 


Finally, create new, simplified slides for the architect templates, ensuring each slide is interactive to provide additional information. Arrange the information comprehensively in the short version.


In a conversation with Lindsay, begin by saying, "Lindsay, I'm onto something big here. I have well-thought-out plans." Make it clear that you're not just asking for money, but also want to share your vision because you believe it will make Lindsay proud. 


Be enthusiastic and share a brief background on the history, including the chart you described in an earlier entry. Begin the conversation on an excited note, "I really wanted to do this in person. When you're back, we've got to find time for lunch."


Proceed to explain your current status. "We've spent six years developing the Property Wizard, forming networks, connections, and conducting market research. Last June, we initiated a soft launch to test our system and gauge interest for our products, compressing our initial 18-month plan."


Highlight the positive feedback received from cold calls and industry network expansion, which prompted you to expedite the timeline by 12 months.


Over the past six months, you've been preparing for a capital raise - collecting case studies, testimonials, creating opportunities, growing clients, increasing revenue, making the right connections, finding industry partners and support.


You've been preparing for your capital raise, developing both your networks and skills, providing evidence of traction, refining your pitch deck, and setting up warm introductions. As a result, you've managed to raise $1.5 million through venture capital and three industry partners.


You're in late-stage conversations with two significant industry partners and are actively servicing two markets. Additionally, you have three significant potential industry investors in three other markets, one of which has already committed.


The conversation may also cover additional topics from earlier notes.


Note to self when discussing. Scratch that. When talking to Lindsay, you can preempt it by saying, look, Lindsay, where aren't into something big here. And that can come right after you've said, but before you consider. Let me explain the situation. 
I 
You can say, look, Lindsay, I'm onto something big here. 
I have well thought out, 
Recent 
Researched, scratch that. I have well thought out plans. 
Yeah, just that first bit. I'm onto something big here. 
Nothing, Mike. 
All right, now we right now ain't cash flow fucked. 
You can say something like, now I am asking you for money, but I am scratch that. 
But I want to telling more because I think you'll be proud in brackets. 
Add this as a footnote to this entry, G P T four. 
Lindsay will like this. It feels like a son, father thing. He likes that kind of advisory stuff. Close brackets being enthusiastic and happy about it. Give that brief background on the history, the chart that you showed earlier on. 
Scratch that the chart that you described in an earlier entry tree. Open brackets. Add this, scratch that. G P T four, add the following as a footnote in your reply search for references to previous entry to combine info, close brackets. 
Start out all excited, be smiley and goofy and start the whole conversation by saying, I really wanted to do this in person. So when we scratch that, so when you are back, we've gotta find time for lunch. 
Now to give you a brief catch up 
To where we are right now, show the chart. 
We spent six years developing the property wizard and forming networks and connections and market research. Market testing, market testing. 
Six months ago, scratch that. In June last year, we started our soft launch to test our system and to test appetite for one of our product, for one of our products, for some of our products rather than the planned 18 months. 
Oh, of further integration, uh, open brackets. You can summarize this bit. I guess scratch that close bracket plan for 18 months to do all this kind of stuff. 
But the response that you've got in both your cold call uptake and, I don't know, success in industry or network expansion or something like that. 
You brought your timeline forward 12 months, uh, right now. 
Scratch that in order to, I don't know, expedite our system them. 
Now we've done that and to do this, we needed to raise capital over six months. Over the last six months, I have been pre preparing for my capital raise, collecting case studies, collecting testimonials, creating opportunities, growing clients, creating revenue, making the right connections, finding industry partners, finding industry association and industry support, 
And grooming yourself for your capital raise both in networks and skills and evidence, traction, developing your traction and your investor network and your pitch and pitch deck and getting warm introductions and developing warm introductions and setting up warm introductions 
Through 
Which you will have raised one and a half million dollars. 
Three venture capital and three industry partners. 
We've been in late stage conversations with two significant industry partners, strategic industry partners in scratch that you have industry partnerships and they're actively servicing two markets at present. 
You have three significant potential industry investors in three other markets. 
One which has already committed, one of which has committed all of whom are well connected or whatever. 
Then maybe something about other stuff from earlier notes.

# Notes to self on strategy and perspective and ideas

2023 [Title] [GPT this section is thoughts and strategy about ConceptV and what I need to do - Tim Geldard]
Get as many of the big guys as possible, raise more many. You can show the resources that went into getting them, lead time and support growth. 

You’re going to increase our revenue with a very very good Business Development management. You’re going to hire 7 specific people to demolish cogs exponentially by building the Property Wizard. You’re going to increase your capacity by refining outsourcing ability and asset library. 

We’re going to build demand in the market by selling the Virtual Tours, and we’ve shown the COA and lead teams on acquisition. We’re going to the build the system behind the product where our customers can simply build VTs themselves, and convert to a SaaS. 

You have found the exact people who are needed to deliver this, and all of them are keen and ready to start this month. 

This is what investors need to see. 

Put Jackie with the sales person. Those two become a 2 person team. 

Write up on position of the company, market, state of things etc for sales person. Give them all the information, and set KPI’s. financially motivate them with milestones. Get them to work with Jackie to come up with a way to do it. 

Work out how much of their investment + your expense will be claimed back as R&D. Show how I can claim back money spent delivering projects. Thus shows smart and effective use of funds. 

In your use of funds slide, show the actual people that will be added to The Team with their funds. Under each person, have a milestone track, showing what they will bring to the business. Like revenue generation for sales, and cost reduction or supply variability or % automated or something. 

Get Michael to make a Splashscreen that gives the user the ability to find all the materials about us. Different tour products, different documents etc. 

Make 20-30 sec video explaining what a Virtual Tour is, and where it can be used. Hire a videographer for this, ask Nick Christy if he knows anyone. 

Get all programmers to adopt as much AI writing code as possible. Everyone needs to look at what we’re doing from an AI perspective. 

Bring Jackie to pitches. She could ntrols slides

“We’re entering the market by building the product FOR them. In the future, the Property Wizard will let the clients build it themselves”

Get Jackie to find pricing on MetaLuxe. Show how much cheaper our build cost is than theirs. 

Explain you have more info if asked. Thing that has changed is I’m prepared, and closed $x sales in last month. Explain what we made, the property wizard, the revenue model and future plan. We’re entering residential sales market, market conditions indicate greater need over next 12 months, and two competitors have entered the market with success. In competition, say we have more information, but are focusing on Lucid Vue and MetaLuxe. Show how and why ours is way better. 

Market movements indicate an increasing demand over the next 12 months, and we plan to use that scale our business. 

Market rates are being set by lucid vue and MetaLuxe. We’re we to charge what they our, our gross profit would be 94%. 

Our Cirtual Tours are cheaper,better, faster and have enormous potential to break more markets. 

We’ve established a cheap and effective go to market strategy over the last few months. Direct contact, complimentary tour, sale. COA is $X for a contract worth $x annually on average. 

Get Jordie and Jackie to get me data on COA and costs etc. get graphs and everything so investors can check it out. 

Build a wizard for contractors that walks them through a demo project and then guides them through the process of their task. 

If we’re creating a wizard for how to make exactly what we need, we open ourselves up to reverse engineering. We can manually encrypt it by getting to put the work together in a confusing way, and we have scripts that change a bunch of the controls files according to a code we’ve made. 

Get Jackie to find the people on the board for target VC companies, and see if I know someone that knows them. Also get Pearl to find those VCs. 

iPhones have the ability to mix LiDAR and photogrammetry. Use a drone and a phone to scan an area. Use AI to read the images, and identify what is what. Based on that, apply rules to generate clean geometry with texture UVs.

To convince Grant: who knows, they might not accept. Either way you win. You’ve seen my one pager. You know what we’re building, and you can already see what it can do now. This is going to be history, don’t you want to be part of something? When Damian invests, you two will both be working on it. Won’t that be cool? 

A potential alternate SaaS: offer your services through design and construct, and build exact replicas of everyone’s documentation. As the Property Wizard improves, you’ll be able to run a fully accurate virtual tour that users can identify the problems with. Build the Property Wizard to something that ArchViz people can pilot it. Then sell su script ions to the ArchViz people.

Use our future AI plans, that doesn’t exist, that no one else can fry it because we make it. VC get hard on. 

If you haven’t got big developers for the pitch, show the demand by using direct competition. 

I’m pitch, when outlining competition, focus on the rigid structure, they can’t adapt with the current volition market. High density luxury residential is big right now because of market movements 24 months. Over the last 12 months, x big builders have gone under. That has reduced capacity by y. As a result, the industry must move away from large developments, little over 6 stories over the coming 12 months. Our direct competitors are Australia based, and their key industry is high density - it’s the only industry where the high cost doesn’t matter too much. Their demand and revenue will dry up. That’s why we’ve been moving into the architectural space. That’s why we’re developing name there, and building passive revenue. Direct competitors are likely wanting to target smaller builds, but their high cost will likely make it difficult. Our cost base is already at 10% of theirs, and with planned development over the next 6 months that is set to drop below 5% - opening up a plethora of markets they cannot access. 

We’re entering the market now. Timing is incredibly important for this. 

When talking about competition, explain how important it is to be nimble - we’re in u chartered territory and the whole industry is constantly changing between extremes. Lucid and Metaluxe are not nimble, and their focus market is their only market. The recent closure of x biggest builders is going to dramatically minimise the amount of high density developments over the next 12 months. This has happened before with different competitors in different markets. Situ systems couldn’t move, cut half their staff and I poached one of their best software engineers. 

Find competitors that have folded over the last two years. 

Next likely big push is in master planned communities, architecture in 12 months. Land developments would have kicked hard after the shortage. Find data. 

You MUST bring more AI into your pitch. These new multi-modal AIs (GPT 4) open up an entirely new way for people to interact with property. Image recognition and language models, combined with our system, can enable extreme efficiency. The Markup Tool, powered by GPT 4 and connected with the Property Wizard, can allow the design coordination of a project to do a process that would take 6 months in a single day. AI that lets people interface with the Virtual Tours enables the Property Wizard to do SO MUCH MORE. 

Find an AI person now. 

Add in the AI wave at the moment to the timing part of pitch? 

For Grant, get him to out in 250k as convertible note with floor clause. Raising more later, will have a higher val. For Damian: we will focus on developing good relationships with suppliers and architects. In 4-6 months, three of us get dinner. He’s a smart guy you said. He will understand what we’re building, and he will invest. 

For Tamara, to get her really pushing: give conditional offer, something to do with performance? Explain options. Explain exactly what it is that you’re building, and what your plans for it are. Building a billion dollar company. 

With Grant money, make him your sales person. Maybe grant additional shares for extra sales in x period. Or, commissions. Get him to setup meetings with developers who aren’t his clients. With Tamara, get all the info from her from her last product library plan, design the system and user interface and get that started. Make first Lean In about educating around supplier specification and say you’re doing research and getting and end client wants (better tech). Offer a free Tour and design tour discounts for people that respond to the survey and agree to interview. Part of survey is a couple of shots of their chosen plan, and a bit of info about it. Then get suppliers on board and build first version of system. Make connection with that researcher. Second lean in like a month or so later, discussing the results of the survey, and the product library you’re making. Do more free tours for first users. 

With grants money, get the AI team going so we can automate creation of supplier materials. Make user portal to standardise supplier onboarding and automate. Do for railclone too. Get Shane working on most common problems with architects. Get lost from Liam on what takes most time, standardise Architect upload. Get mock-ups from Jackie to show system for suppliers. Build plug-in for design software that connects with product library. Maybe use the product library stuff as a way of forcing designers to configure their model on a particular way, a way that makes it faster for us to do a Tour. 

For for all brain trust to do an AI course. Get Louie help to choose which one. 

Trademark Digital Tours

Push Grant and Tamara. 

Add a BDM to pitch. Your theme is time. Opportunity, setup and dev opportunity. You are ready to take on high volume. You have almost no time to dedicate to sales, majority is through using your network, which while large, is still developing. You are limited by your time in BDM role. Opportunity in development market is still there, but with market conditions that’s likely to dry up within 12 months at most. You’ve got a huge capacity and you’re building it more. You have an incredible value proposition that literally no one else can give. The colsest competition is charging an enourmius amount for an inferior product. All those restricted from using their product by price, but who want to, now have the ability to do. 

Explain the bit above

Hire both software developer and data scientist. They both build PW and V at same
Time. 

Spend money on that AI team from Amazon to build V2.0 of Vi. Make sure to get it made so GPT 4 can built swapped in later. For code, pay to be in python with clear documentation. 

For pitch, include rebranding to Vi. 

With direct access to developers pioneering AI models, we’re finally able to integrate AI to our company wide system and change the game. Early prototypes are supporting the thesis of AI compatibility. In fact, a crude system + prototype pair will generate a summary, to do lists along side suggestions and instructions, and delegate resultant work just from this conversation. 

I know I’m not the best financial manager on the world but Lyndsey, the whole world is about to change and it’s going to be quick. We are in the optimal position to not just ride the wave, but be part of making it.  (Refined and punchy version of this would make a great intro, along with something like ‘we (important to include him in your opening statements and everything company relates by saying you and I at the start, and we from then on) are on the verge of making history. I have good reason to believe that we’re a unicorn. We have next generation technology, strong market presence, a never before seen, market tested product, first movers in a massive blue ocean (something to say a replicable product type for like hundreds of adjacent markets), something like ‘a fully standardised delivery process that will service the whole world in less than 5 years.’ Conservative ARR for FY24 are $X even in a down economy. I’m relation to the down economy, you are taking advantage of the fact the economy is down. Why? Because developers at at risk of massive losses, everyone needs presales for debt. Everyone wants our competitors product, but only a select few can afford it. We’re bringing an upgraded offering at a fraction of the cost and are making it really easy/non exclusive for the remaining seperate developers to access it. Besides, our whole package is profitable at the same price as competitors providing renders alone. 

For Tim - other question prompts to come up with 

During initial elevator summary, 

Barrel - oat cappuccino 

You’re and AI proptech company working with developers to get their projects to market on time. too to get developments get to market earlier. 

saving developers time by simplifying/streamlining the design and sale stages. 

I run an AI proptech company. I work with developers to reduce time and money through design and sale. 

Super Human

South African investor - say something about castle lager 

‘Programmer’ - Eric investment NZ

BDM must be in a good network. Get someone expensive who is big in the developer world. 

I’m a brilliant guy with a great thing. Im looking for someone with a good network who will help me clean up the company and scale. 

For Lindsay, you’ve started making significant connections in property development giant owners, Venture Capital, governing industry bodies, technology, architecture in preparation for a mass launch. I’ve got the technology, the team, and the traction to be a unicorn. I need even cashflow to cover pits in revenue, and time for these connections to crystallise. 

Now. For downside protection. We have $250k committed, R&D and $x in revenue. Upside %=

You need to be touring, making connections. Going to these events, networking. You’ve got opportunity to be presenting at these events, yet you’re not taking them. You need to be flying places, expanding your network.   Money is holding you back. 

For Lindsay, you could talk about the side revenue opportunities. Your Vi is already as efficient as 3 people. You studied ML and neural networks when you started this, and the whole system is setup to automate a huge amount of management. We’re advancing, packaging and selling modules of Vi and we develop. 

For Lindsay explain what happened that you need it and why it’s unlikely to happen again. One section on Historic Finance Strategy, Compressed Timeline, Opportunity Lead Time, Resource Limitations: lean bootstrap, lumpy model. Lead time on opportunity, cost increase from shortening timeline. Why the same problem won’t happen again: Revenue in Pipeline, R&D, Industry Investment. What happens if no VC - Action: Extend timeline, reduce scope. Cashflow: R&D, Industry Investor, Revenue. What happens if no Industry Investor - Action: same as above. Cashflow: Revenue. Even low conversion, still x amount runway. No revenue, loan and R&D gets me x months. 

For Lindsay, could outline key sensitivities, the responses to SWOT. Could make a risk matrix after the SWOT. 

Perhaps for Lindsay, but for pitches in general, when talking about AI and Vi, the very fact of its existence as a vanilla, limited version cuts out so many obstacles

# Pearl and Tim Summarrised

﻿Conversation between Pearl (advisor) and Tim (CEO of ConceptV) 4 April 23:


Tim: The raise is now up to about 1.5 million. We've got three industry investors, one in luxury sales space, one of the largest architects in Australia, and we've just started the initial process for the commercial fit outs company. We're trying to make strategic partnerships and have initiatives moving in a few different areas.


Tim: We recently got a director from the Australian Institute of Architects on board, and we're presenting through AIA and other major industry bodies to their audience in about two months. Our major challenge is internal resources and being chronically understaffed.


Tim: We have many revenue opportunities, but cash flow is a struggle. In terms of the pitch, I would follow a similar structure to the 12-pager, introducing the product first, then moving into what we're doing with it, the different products in different markets, relationships, and the problem.


Pearl: You mentioned you have three strategic investors and are looking to raise 1.5 million. Is that correct?


Tim: Yes, 750k is through the industry investors.


Tim: Only 250k is committed, and the other two are in the later stages of discussion. We're thinking about getting another 750k from angel or VC-type investors.


Pearl: Have you discussed valuation and terms of the deal with the strategic investors?


Tim: Yes, 4 million held in a convertible note until the full raise is closed.


Pearl: So it's 4 million pre-money at 250k?


Tim: Yes, the commitment is all good with the 4 million pre.


Pearl: I think the valuation is broadly reasonable. In terms of the pitch deck and raising strategy, there are pros and cons to sending a one-pager or the whole pitch deck first. The most common approach is to send the whole pitch deck.


Tim: The slide indicates that we expect to convert to a mostly SaaS-based system in four to five years. Currently, we have subscription clients who pay for virtual tours for different homes or kits on their website.


Pearl: What does it mean to have subscription clients?


Tim: They have our tools on their website and pay a subscription to keep them live. As for the key user of the platform, there are different ones depending on the sector. In commercial fit-outs, it's the fit-out company; in architecture, it's the architect; and in the volume builder space, it's someone else.


Pearl: If I'm an architect and want to use Concept B, what's the process of getting my plan into a virtual tour on the platform?


Tim: They send us a request for a product type, and upload their files. We currently turn those plans into 3D models, but we're continuing automation until it's completely automated.


Pearl: Your vision for the SaaS is that architects can upload their plans, and they immediately get turned into a 3D tour?


Tim: Yes.


Pearl: A SaaS model is more attractive to tech VCs than a consulting or service-based model. Emphasizing your vision on the SaaS side will help. However, if the SaaS product will only come around in four to five years, it might be a tough sell for investors, as you'll probably require more investment to continue the company's growth and reach that product.


Tim: We've already built version one of our system, which we're using to create repeat projects instead of one-off sales. We make partnerships with people in the industry and charge a fixed percentage of their revenue. We're developing product systems for different services with partners, then templating and packaging that to sell to everyone else. It's all about setting up repeat business.


Tim: We're continuously developing our system, which has an 86% gross profit per project. Our capacity to output projects is significantly higher now and we're not hitting the capacity. We expect to be profitable by June. There are many strategies planned for the next couple of years.


Pearl: When you mention an 86% gross profit margin, what are the components of the cost of goods sold (COGS)?


Tim: The system we made breaks everything down into basic components, like Lego bricks. Each project involves assembling these Lego bricks, which currently requires human labor. COGS consists of the labor required to put these pieces together and the cost of rendering, which is about $18 per tour, as well as subscriptions and software.


Pearl: I think it's important to emphasize that point, as many investors might assume a services-based business would have much lower margins due to labor costs.


Tim: We built a property wizard that allows us to do it with very little labor. Is that a good way to showcase that there isn't much labor involved?


Pearl: Yes, and one way to frame the story is that you've built the property wizard, automating most of the process and requiring minimal human input, resulting in high gross profit margins. You're now working to remove any human input and fully automate the process, ultimately creating a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product for clients that requires no touch on your end.


Tim: Focusing on what we've built right now and why it's great in our current model, while outlining the future potential without going into too much detail, sounds like a good approach.


Pearl: The risk with your current deck is that people might think you're a consulting project-based business with a main product focused on service rather than technology. However, it sounds like you're actually a software business that's built a tech product currently requiring some human input, and you need investment to fully automate it into a SaaS product.


Pearl: The software product offers great scalability since it's not reliant on a services aspect.


Tim: Even before it's a fully automated system, it can be scaled, franchised, and spread all over the world. The property wizard can be completely outsourced easily. Is that worth mentioning?


Pearl: Let me think about it. If your key focus is building it into a SaaS product, highlighting that might be more attractive to investors. Emphasizing a franchising growth or overseas expansion piece could make it seem like the SaaS model isn't your top priority.


Tim: That makes sense, thank you. I'm going to be in Sydney next week. Is there a chance we could catch up for a coffee or drink?


Pearl: Absolutely, I'm based around the city. Let me know when you're available, and we can schedule a time.


Tim: I'll send you an email to schedule. Also, any advice on crafting our story for investors?


Pearl: One of my peers released a helpful article today on how to craft a story for founders and what VC investors look for. I'll share it with you – it's a great step-by-step guide.


Tim: That would be fantastic. My chief priority is telling the right story in a whole different space.


Pearl: No problem. We can also discuss introductions to other investors and warm introductions when we meet. Are you going to be in Sydney often over the next year?


Tim: Most likely, and I can be.


Pearl: There are startup events with founders and investors that you could attend. One quarterly event focuses on early-stage startups and has many angel investors and early-stage VCs. Attending these events can help you network and have valuable conversations with potential investors.


Tim: I'm thinking about events, but the challenge at the moment is time.


Pearl: One thing to bring out more in your deck is that you're about to be profitable in June but you're raising money. It's a strong position since many startups raise money because they're out of cash, but you're raising money to capitalize on opportunities to grow. I think that's important to mention in the deck.


Tim: How can I go about doing that? Would I make a specific point about it or would I lace it into different parts?


Pearl: I would put it on the funding page, slide 13 in your deck, where you talk about your raise.


Tim: So, talk about where we are in terms of being fine with slow growth if we don't get funding, but we're raising money to push up because we have identified opportunities.


Pearl: Yes, exactly. You could say you're about to be break-even in June, but you want to raise money to supercharge your growth on identified opportunities.


Tim: Should that be text, some kind of graphic, or a quote?


Pearl: I think I'd have it as text.


Tim: Let's find a time to sit down and catch up next week when you're in Sydney.


Pearl: Great, nice to chat and I'm excited to finally meet you in person next week. Take care and have a good rest of your day.


Tim: You too, thanks.

# Reds Group (Property Developer)

 
 
26 August 2022  
 
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
Reds Group are a commercial development company delivering community oriented spaces across 
Queensland.  
A projects design is the combined effort of architects, engineers, interior designers, lighting 
designers, landscape designers and many other moving parts all with a common goal: design a space 
fit for it’s purpose. With so many stakeholders involved, we experience significant difficulties that 
largely boil down to efficiency, and timeliness, of design communication. Everyone has their own IP, 
their own software and no one owns the whole thing. As a result, there’s a high level of risk for 
errors when it’s all brought together.  
When those errors are caught, there’s significant back and forth between revisions and reviews. 
When they’re not, they show up during construction or post completion – leading to re-work, late 
stage alterations or an end result that isn’t effectively designed for purpose. In any case, those 
design errors wind up costing large amounts in both time and money. 
Another difficulty we face during design is communicating design intent to the designers.  
“I want buildings that belong and look like they’ve been there for a long time. Having the view on 
how we want the facades to look, in context, at the earliest stages will save a great amount of time 
in policing what the architects are doing later on. Because it’s hard to manage what the architect 
think is the right method for designing a shop.” Jason Blair – Property Director of Reds Group 
We engaged Tim from ConceptV in November 2021 for a trial on one of our active projects in 
Everton Park. Tim was introduced by a business associate who had trialled ConceptV’s services and 
recommended we have a meeting. After explaining the difficulties we have, Tim provided us with a 
proposal for how his platform could help address those problems. We accepted Tim’s proposal for a 
6 weeks trial on our P6 project, which was in the work up phase at the time.  
ConceptV were provided with the requested files, and Tim was nominated as one of our project 
leads for the project. Tim was to be involved in fortnightly design discussions with the other project 
leads, updating the tour with new information, suggesting and developing tools based on feedback 
from the team.  
 
 
 
 
 In the 6 weeks after ConceptV’s platform was delivered, the team discovered: 
 a disparity of revisions between the architect, kitchen designer and bar design 
 an element of the kitchen design impeding communication flow amongst kitchen staff by the 
head chef 
 a kitchen rack with incorrect dimensions that would not fit in the space 
Since the trial ended, we contracted ConceptV to continue evolving the platform with design 
progress, and they are designing additional functions specifically built for our projects and process.  
The tour has been highly beneficial as a communication tools, especially among the many non-
technical stakeholders. Explaining the project in financial, legal and client meetings is much easier, 
and is far more comprehensible in a holistic sense than technical plans alone.  
We’re looking at this as a potential solution to the difficulties outlined above. With the 
understanding that the platform will evolve to fit new uses, we intend on utilising the virtual tour 
during the remainder of design, during construction, as part of our marketing and as a tool visitors of 
the development can use to find helpful information while there. From what we’ve experienced so 
far, the unique platform ConceptV have developed will likely fulfill it’s objective and go on to deliver 
further value in additional stages of the development process.  
We’ve already engaged ConceptV for another development in Redcliffe ( Reds Group - Redcliffe ) after 
discussing the advantages of using their platform from the very start of a project, allowing us to 
develop the concept design with respect to the surrounding environment. They later provided us a 
proposal with custom made tools, which we accepted.  
“One of the biggest costs in the business is building things when surrounding elements haven’t been 
considered properly. Often people can’t afford to rebuild, so have to learn to live with the mistakes, 
or mask them. The Digital Tour is making us think about the space as a whole, before we build it, 
avoiding mistakes and profit loss. That’s ultimately the value of the 3D model if compared to 
traditional methods.” Jason Blair – Property Director of Reds Group 
There have been teething problems during the process which was not unexpected, but overall the 
Tour provided by ConceptV has had a positive impact on our process and has helped identify design 
issues that would have been incredibly difficult otherwise. To date, we have not seen anything else 
like it in the market. It is a unique product that has the potential to bring significant time and cost 
savings to our business.  
“’Success’ for this partnership means that we're able to use the model all the time as we’re planning 
the venue, building it visually before incurring the construction cost. It’s also a matter of managing 
the input level from everyone - and making the model work.” Jason Blair 
After using it for the last 10 months, we’re impressed with the potential and have begun 
implementing it on other projects. We have 7 other active project which we intend on bringing 
ConceptV on board for.  
“The practical use of this platform has some incredible efficiencies, especially considering we tend to 
use the same team for multiple projects. I want to reduce the scope of the designers and get their 
input later rather than earlier, as their method of work is very rigid and hard to make changes 
without going out of the tender. From the business perspective, we need more time and certainty to 
assess viability before committing to a certain design. “ Jason Blair  We believe that ConceptVs unique innovation has considerable application in the property industry, 
and we look forward to continuing to work with them.  
 
Yours sincerely 
REDS GROUP PTY LTD

# Reflections on people, pitches, business strategy, perspectiove

[Heading] Reflections on people, pitches, business strategy, perspective by Tim Geldard referring to himself (up until May 2023):

2023
Get as many of the big guys as possible, raise more many. You can show the resources that went into getting them, lead time and support growth. 

You’re going to increase our revenue with a very very good Business Development management. You’re going to hire 7 specific people to demolish cogs exponentially by building the Property Wizard. You’re going to increase your capacity by refining outsourcing ability and asset library. 

We’re going to build demand in the market by selling the Virtual Tours, and we’ve shown the COA and lead teams on acquisition. We’re going to the build the system behind the product where our customers can simply build VTs themselves, and convert to a SaaS. 

You have found the exact people who are needed to deliver this, and all of them are keen and ready to start this month. 

This is what investors need to see. 

Put Jackie with the sales person. Those two become a 2 person team. 

Write up on position of the company, market, state of things etc for sales person. Give them all the information, and set KPI’s. financially motivate them with milestones. Get them to work with Jackie to come up with a way to do it. 

Work out how much of their investment + your expense will be claimed back as R&D. Show how I can claim back money spent delivering projects. Thus shows smart and effective use of funds. 

In your use of funds slide, show the actual people that will be added to The Team with their funds. Under each person, have a milestone track, showing what they will bring to the business. Like revenue generation for sales, and cost reduction or supply variability or % automated or something. 

Get Michael to make a Splashscreen that gives the user the ability to find all the materials about us. Different tour products, different documents etc. 

Make 20-30 sec video explaining what a Virtual Tour is, and where it can be used. Hire a videographer for this, ask Nick Christy if he knows anyone. 

Get all programmers to adopt as much AI writing code as possible. Everyone needs to look at what we’re doing from an AI perspective. 

Bring Jackie to pitches. She could ntrols slides

“We’re entering the market by building the product FOR them. In the future, the Property Wizard will let the clients build it themselves”

Get Jackie to find pricing on MetaLuxe. Show how much cheaper our build cost is than theirs. 

Explain you have more info if asked. Thing that has changed is I’m prepared, and closed $x sales in last month. Explain what we made, the property wizard, the revenue model and future plan. We’re entering residential sales market, market conditions indicate greater need over next 12 months, and two competitors have entered the market with success. In competition, say we have more information, but are focusing on Lucid Vue and MetaLuxe. Show how and why ours is way better. 

Market movements indicate an increasing demand over the next 12 months, and we plan to use that scale our business. 

Market rates are being set by lucid vue and MetaLuxe. We’re we to charge what they our, our gross profit would be 94%. 

Our Cirtual Tours are cheaper,better, faster and have enormous potential to break more markets. 

We’ve established a cheap and effective go to market strategy over the last few months. Direct contact, complimentary tour, sale. COA is $X for a contract worth $x annually on average. 

Get Jordie and Jackie to get me data on COA and costs etc. get graphs and everything so investors can check it out. 

Build a wizard for contractors that walks them through a demo project and then guides them through the process of their task. 

If we’re creating a wizard for how to make exactly what we need, we open ourselves up to reverse engineering. We can manually encrypt it by getting to put the work together in a confusing way, and we have scripts that change a bunch of the controls files according to a code we’ve made. 

Get Jackie to find the people on the board for target VC companies, and see if I know someone that knows them. Also get Pearl to find those VCs. 

iPhones have the ability to mix LiDAR and photogrammetry. Use a drone and a phone to scan an area. Use AI to read the images, and identify what is what. Based on that, apply rules to generate clean geometry with texture UVs.

To convince Grant: who knows, they might not accept. Either way you win. You’ve seen my one pager. You know what we’re building, and you can already see what it can do now. This is going to be history, don’t you want to be part of something? When Damian invests, you two will both be working on it. Won’t that be cool? 

A potential alternate SaaS: offer your services through design and construct, and build exact replicas of everyone’s documentation. As the Property Wizard improves, you’ll be able to run a fully accurate virtual tour that users can identify the problems with. Build the Property Wizard to something that ArchViz people can pilot it. Then sell su script ions to the ArchViz people.

Use our future AI plans, that doesn’t exist, that no one else can fry it because we make it. VC get hard on. 

If you haven’t got big developers for the pitch, show the demand by using direct competition. 

I’m pitch, when outlining competition, focus on the rigid structure, they can’t adapt with the current volition market. High density luxury residential is big right now because of market movements 24 months. Over the last 12 months, x big builders have gone under. That has reduced capacity by y. As a result, the industry must move away from large developments, little over 6 stories over the coming 12 months. Our direct competitors are Australia based, and their key industry is high density - it’s the only industry where the high cost doesn’t matter too much. Their demand and revenue will dry up. That’s why we’ve been moving into the architectural space. That’s why we’re developing name there, and building passive revenue. Direct competitors are likely wanting to target smaller builds, but their high cost will likely make it difficult. Our cost base is already at 10% of theirs, and with planned development over the next 6 months that is set to drop below 5% - opening up a plethora of markets they cannot access. 

We’re entering the market now. Timing is incredibly important for this. 

When talking about competition, explain how important it is to be nimble - we’re in u chartered territory and the whole industry is constantly changing between extremes. Lucid and Metaluxe are not nimble, and their focus market is their only market. The recent closure of x biggest builders is going to dramatically minimise the amount of high density developments over the next 12 months. This has happened before with different competitors in different markets. Situ systems couldn’t move, cut half their staff and I poached one of their best software engineers. 

Find competitors that have folded over the last two years. 

Next likely big push is in master planned communities, architecture in 12 months. Land developments would have kicked hard after the shortage. Find data. 

You MUST bring more AI into your pitch. These new multi-modal AIs (GPT 4) open up an entirely new way for people to interact with property. Image recognition and language models, combined with our system, can enable extreme efficiency. The Markup Tool, powered by GPT 4 and connected with the Property Wizard, can allow the design coordination of a project to do a process that would take 6 months in a single day. AI that lets people interface with the Virtual Tours enables the Property Wizard to do SO MUCH MORE. 

Find an AI person now. 

Add in the AI wave at the moment to the timing part of pitch? 

For Grant, get him to out in 250k as convertible note with floor clause. Raising more later, will have a higher val. For Damian: we will focus on developing good relationships with suppliers and architects. In 4-6 months, three of us get dinner. He’s a smart guy you said. He will understand what we’re building, and he will invest. 

For Tamara, to get her really pushing: give conditional offer, something to do with performance? Explain options. Explain exactly what it is that you’re building, and what your plans for it are. Building a billion dollar company. 

With Grant money, make him your sales person. Maybe grant additional shares for extra sales in x period. Or, commissions. Get him to setup meetings with developers who aren’t his clients. With Tamara, get all the info from her from her last product library plan, design the system and user interface and get that started. Make first Lean In about educating around supplier specification and say you’re doing research and getting and end client wants (better tech). Offer a free Tour and design tour discounts for people that respond to the survey and agree to interview. Part of survey is a couple of shots of their chosen plan, and a bit of info about it. Then get suppliers on board and build first version of system. Make connection with that researcher. Second lean in like a month or so later, discussing the results of the survey, and the product library you’re making. Do more free tours for first users. 

With grants money, get the AI team going so we can automate creation of supplier materials. Make user portal to standardise supplier onboarding and automate. Do for railclone too. Get Shane working on most common problems with architects. Get lost from Liam on what takes most time, standardise Architect upload. Get mock-ups from Jackie to show system for suppliers. Build plug-in for design software that connects with product library. Maybe use the product library stuff as a way of forcing designers to configure their model on a particular way, a way that makes it faster for us to do a Tour. 

For for all brain trust to do an AI course. Get Louie help to choose which one. 

Trademark Digital Tours

Push Grant and Tamara. 

Add a BDM to pitch. Your theme is time. Opportunity, setup and dev opportunity. You are ready to take on high volume. You have almost no time to dedicate to sales, majority is through using your network, which while large, is still developing. You are limited by your time in BDM role. Opportunity in development market is still there, but with market conditions that’s likely to dry up within 12 months at most. You’ve got a huge capacity and you’re building it more. You have an incredible value proposition that literally no one else can give. The colsest competition is charging an enourmius amount for an inferior product. All those restricted from using their product by price, but who want to, now have the ability to do. 

Explain the bit above

Hire both software developer and data scientist. They both build PW and V at same
Time. 

Spend money on that AI team from Amazon to build V2.0 of Vi. Make sure to get it made so GPT 4 can built swapped in later. For code, pay to be in python with clear documentation. 

For pitch, include rebranding to Vi. 

With direct access to developers pioneering AI models, we’re finally able to integrate AI to our company wide system and change the game. Early prototypes are supporting the thesis of AI compatibility. In fact, a crude system + prototype pair will generate a summary, to do lists along side suggestions and instructions, and delegate resultant work just from this conversation. 

I know I’m not the best financial manager on the world but Lyndsey, the whole world is about to change and it’s going to be quick. We are in the optimal position to not just ride the wave, but be part of making it.  (Refined and punchy version of this would make a great intro, along with something like ‘we (important to include him in your opening statements and everything company relates by saying you and I at the start, and we from then on) are on the verge of making history. I have good reason to believe that we’re a unicorn. We have next generation technology, strong market presence, a never before seen, market tested product, first movers in a massive blue ocean (something to say a replicable product type for like hundreds of adjacent markets), something like ‘a fully standardised delivery process that will service the whole world in less than 5 years.’ Conservative ARR for FY24 are $X even in a down economy. I’m relation to the down economy, you are taking advantage of the fact the economy is down. Why? Because developers at at risk of massive losses, everyone needs presales for debt. Everyone wants our competitors product, but only a select few can afford it. We’re bringing an upgraded offering at a fraction of the cost and are making it really easy/non exclusive for the remaining seperate developers to access it. Besides, our whole package is profitable at the same price as competitors providing renders alone. 

For Tim - other question prompts to come up with 

During initial elevator summary, 

Barrel - oat cappuccino 

You’re and AI proptech company working with developers to get their projects to market on time. too to get developments get to market earlier. 

saving developers time by simplifying/streamlining the design and sale stages. 

I run an AI proptech company. I work with developers to reduce time and money through design and sale. 

Super Human

South African investor - say something about castle lager 

‘Programmer’ - Eric investment NZ

BDM must be in a good network. Get someone expensive who is big in the developer world. 

I’m a brilliant guy with a great thing. Im looking for someone with a good network who will help me clean up the company and scale. 

For Lindsay, you’ve started making significant connections in property development giant owners, Venture Capital, governing industry bodies, technology, architecture in preparation for a mass launch. I’ve got the technology, the team, and the traction to be a unicorn. I need even cashflow to cover pits in revenue, and time for these connections to crystallise. 

Now. For downside protection. We have $250k committed, R&D and $x in revenue. Upside %=

You need to be touring, making connections. Going to these events, networking. You’ve got opportunity to be presenting at these events, yet you’re not taking them. You need to be flying places, expanding your network.   Money is holding you back. 

For Lindsay, you could talk about the side revenue opportunities. Your Vi is already as efficient as 3 people. You studied ML and neural networks when you started this, and the whole system is setup to automate a huge amount of management. We’re advancing, packaging and selling modules of Vi and we develop. 

For Lindsay explain what happened that you need it and why it’s unlikely to happen again. One section on Historic Finance Strategy, Compressed Timeline, Opportunity Lead Time, Resource Limitations: lean bootstrap, lumpy model. Lead time on opportunity, cost increase from shortening timeline. Why the same problem won’t happen again: Revenue in Pipeline, R&D, Industry Investment. What happens if no VC - Action: Extend timeline, reduce scope. Cashflow: R&D, Industry Investor, Revenue. What happens if no Industry Investor - Action: same as above. Cashflow: Revenue. Even low conversion, still x amount runway. No revenue, loan and R&D gets me x months. 

For Lindsay, could outline key sensitivities, the responses to SWOT. Could make a risk matrix after the SWOT. 

Perhaps for Lindsay, but for pitches in general, when talking about AI and Vi, the very fact of its existence as a vanilla, limited version cuts out so many obstacles

# Sean McBurnie (Investor)

Invest or Letter of Recomme ndation  28 August 2022  
To whom  it may concern,  
I am a private investor  with experience across  some of the world ’s largest investment funds, 
including  recently as  part of Aware Super ’s Real Estate investment team , where I engaged in 
direct equity investment  and portfolio ma nagement of a multibillion -dollar  property  portfolio.  
I had the p leasure of investing in Con ceptV in April of this year , having  first become familiar 
with the Company in 2018 when it was in an early conceptual stage . I have been e xtremely 
impressed  with the progress Tim has made since this time , and the opportunity to partner with 
him as an investor and advisor has me exc ited for the future traje ctory of the Company.  As an 
advisor , I have been able to bring my wealth of institu tional invest ment, due diligence , and real 
estate sector knowledge to partner with ConceptV and provide T im with strategic guidance as 
the Company pursues its ambitious next stage of growth . 
The market for Prop Tech is significant and growing, an d my investment was based on a 
fundamenta l belief th at Concept V offers an enduring value prop osition to stakeholders across 
the property value chain . I have seen firsthand  as an institutional  investor how the construction 
and development  process is cumbersome , unwieldy,  and costly.  By disintermediating the 
design and construction process with its innovative  Virtual Tour  offering, Concept V has global 
potenti al to support a range of industry stakehol ders, including architects , developers , 
builders, occupants,  and investor s, to improve the effi ciency of the industry overall . 
ConceptV ’s commercialisation has proven promising since the time of my investm ent and has 
been based on a well-considered strategic approach to the management of organisational 
growth  and change . Tim has built an extensive network across not only the property industry , 
but has drawn on appr opriate legal , financial and techn ical support in order to execute on his 
strategy . I have been consiste ntly impressed with Tim ’s purposive approach with respect to  
scaling ConceptV and his prudent deployment of capital to support the operational expansion 
and improvement of a v ariety of internal functions . Among these include:  
• Sales  – in growing ConceptV ’s client base over the cou rse of 20 22 with reputable  and 
high-quality  counterparties  in line with the go -to-market strategy and service  rollou t; 
• Operations and deliverance  – in ensuring  personnel growth ha s been tailored  to 
support recognised and critical business needs ; and  
• Product and t echnology  – through  a focus on iterating and improving the Virtual Tour  
offering to generate both time and cost efficiencies internally whilst responding to end 
user demand and improving the product experience . 
In impl ementing the go-to-market strategy, Tim has consistently demonstrated willingness to 
take onboard feedba ck and pivot t o the most prospective and pressing requirements facing 
the Co mpany. In doing so, he has been able to drive the best outcomes for his clients, staff 
and investors, which will serve him well as the commercialisation phase  continues to ramp u p. 
I am excit ed by the potential for the Ignite Ideas Fund to accelerate the growth of ConceptV ’s 
commercialis ation . Today , Concept V services a range of resident ial property players whilst 
partly t apping into the commercial property market . I have seen first hand , working in 
conjunction with Australia ’s largest property players, including Lendlease, how  the Virtual Tour  
offering can  provide effic iency advantages across not only the residential, bu t also the office, 
retail, and industrial sector s. The ease of accessibility and configu rability related to the visual 
outputs it produces is unmatched in the mar ket, especially from a cost st andpoint , and its 
applications have the potential to dis rupt not only key elements of property design , but also 
extend to property and construction management and serve as a key tool for enhancing the 
occupan t experience and investor due diligence . Invest or Letter of Recomme ndation  28 August 2022  
A grant from t he Ignite Ideas F und will see Concept V able to accelerate it s current 
commercialisation and growth strategies  in order to serve these critical adjacen t markets in a 
much shorter timeframe than would otherwise be possible.  In doing so , the grant will enhance 
ConceptV ’s ability to promote future f unding rounds, in turn support ing more r apid innovation 
and the creation of sustainable high-tech jobs. Today, ConceptV is not a nebulous  idea on a 
page but a very real service  on the cusp of trans forming the property industry  if provided with 
the appropriate runway to support its growth . 
As a Queensland native, it is always encouraging to see homegrow n products and services 
with broad national and international applicability . ConceptV is ideally positioned to support 
not only the State’s booming construction industry over t he next decade , but global innovation 
across the property value chain . I continue to be excited by ConceptV ’s potential  and T im’s 
impressive capabilit ies as a founder and CEO in exe cuting on his vision  for the b etterm ent of 
one of  Queensland ’s, Australia ’s and the wor ld’s most important industries.  
Yours  sincerely ,

# Team Meeting Summarised

﻿ConceptV Team Meeting 9/05/2023


Tim: Thank you all for coming. This meeting is critical as we need to discuss the company's status. There are three critical factors to starting a company: timing, the product, and networks. Of these, timing is the most challenging to get right. 


We built the company using the lean startup methodology, bootstrapping it with a total of $200K over six years. Our financing strategy comprised of investment, the research and development tax incentive, and sales. 


In June, we entered the soft launch stage, expecting it to last 12-18 months. However, due to overwhelming interest, we expedited the timeline, necessitating the hiring of additional team members. 


Recently, managing my time has become a challenge, given my numerous responsibilities. This difficulty extends to juggling immediate, medium, and long-term objectives, especially cash flow management. 


We've managed to run the company for six years without missing any payrolls, a rare achievement for startups. However, the next month could be challenging. 


In our three-month pipeline, we anticipate about $160K in revenue from various sources. Despite this, we're experiencing a short-term cash gap. 


Typically, companies have an overdraft facility, but due to our company's stage, securing one is challenging. An initial plan fell through, leaving us in a difficult financial position. 


We have about $100K confirmed through R&D and a $250K commitment, among other potential income sources. Despite the current challenge, we are very close to a significant breakthrough. 


To navigate this situation, we have several strategies. We have numerous outstanding invoices, which, once issued, could generate a minimum of $20K. 


The rest of my week is dedicated to networking meetings with VC people in Sydney and a developer summit. I need your help in organizing all the materials I require. 


Specifically, Liam, I need you to retrieve 3D files from previous emails. Jordy, I need you to review recent emails to ensure we have all the necessary materials.


Liam, I need you to estimate the time required for the project outlined in our emails and the previous proposal. Adjust the proposal based on the new information. 


Jay, assess if you have all the information for the fitouts. Determine what you need and where to get the furniture. Give me an estimate for the required budget and any additional requirements. Liaise with Liam before our 4:30 meeting and have questions ready. 


Next, review all material from Angela, assuming a similar level of modeling quality to the PDF. For Angela's project and the OPD one, consider stage delivery. For OPD, time is critical, so create a layout-quality tour as soon as possible.


Michael, coordinate with Liam and Jackie on your work schedule. For the Angela project, due for the AIA in a month, prepare three different quality levels using a style switcher. Provide estimates for these and ensure invoices are sent out by midday tomorrow.


In terms of additional funding, I'll discuss bridging finance with our initial investors. I have meetings set with Lindsay this weekend and two more early next week. Jackie and I will plan for our conversation with Lindsay. 


We are close to achieving significant breakthroughs. There's Tamara's project, the AIA meeting, potential investment and jobs from Mode Architecture, commercial fitout opportunities, and others. Despite the cash flow issue, I'm confident we'll navigate this situation successfully.


I apologize for letting you down and failing in my responsibilities. If you have any questions, please ask. We're all navigating new territory here.


Jackie: I'll be handling quote files among other tasks.


Tim: Most of the files just require PDF conversion, except for OPD and Angela's, which need full proposals. We'll need to prioritize tasks as this might delay some opportunities. We could potentially push the AIA event back.


Jackie: That's feasible since they have three other events on the same day.


Tim: Excellent. We'll delay it by two weeks. On the VC front, the company's committed value has grown to $4 million from $2.75 million in February. This increase implies that potential investors are willing to invest $250K based on the $4 million valuation. In two months, when we approach VCs, I aim for a $6 million valuation. The progress we've made in three months is incredible. Our development side has made significant strides, particularly in rendering and pipeline system development.


However, time management remains a challenge for me. Consequently, next week's pay might be delayed by up to two weeks. Please bear with the situation and ask any necessary questions. Our communication system needs improvement, which is something we all need to work on. 


I've set up a virtual assistant to automatically convert our meeting into a report and action items, which should enhance our communication. 


In terms of tasks, Luke's invoice needs to be paid, although he could only afford half.


Jackie: Should I have started on the splash screen?


Tim: That was decided last night. Also, Michael, I mentioned a splash screen for the QR code. Jackie's already started on it. I need you to take the mockup with six tours and add the video and one-pager. After that, please work on a landing page as soon as possible. I'm meeting with the network tomorrow, and having the landing page ready would be fantastic.

# Tim and a job Lindsay Pitch

Tim and a job Lindsay Pitch
Tim: Um, I wanted to start off with like friendly stuff, chit chat, just that and whatever. And then I want to go with something that is like really exciting. I'm probably gonna make point of the fact that I'm at work at the moment because we've just had a massive breakthrough with some really cool shit to get him excited.
And then, um, also go into what I've been doing for the last two weeks and like now the last three months has been absolutely wild. The amount of stuff that we've been doing. And then go into, now I've got some stuff to show you. Um, I will give you a, but I'll give you a heads up. I will be like, what? We're seeking bridging financing and that'll be, how should I go about that basically?
But cuz like, I don't want it to just come up halfway through about me being like, Hey, I have some Mike. Because that'll really stay in. Anything else? No, 
Tom: I think, I wanna say, I think, I think like touch on the friendly stuff, like friendly introductions, but not too long. Cause like Lucy's bullshit, right? He wants to get along with it and he would want like to know what's been happening with your company.
Like what? Tell him the good news first. Yeah. Tell him like, you're progressing, you're growing. Have lots of these opportunities in the pipeline. Um, tell him, show him that you like, see the risk. Associated with the current market as well and say how, how, tell the story of how you are having positive uptake because it is a cost saving tool.
Yeah. So I doing their business And go into the way that where, because you need to acknowledge the risks, right? Yeah. And then 
Tim: sort of outline with being tenure manager or whatever. 
Tom: Yeah. We'll talk, you can talk about, I'll weave the AI thing into it as like we may have a significant. Improvement in our efficiency and our costs.
That might mean that we don't need to bring on as many people if we can work through this thing, but that's gonna be a little while In the medium term, we're still gonna need to bring on some more people to keep up with our current growth. Yeah. That's point stagnate and not stagnate. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but like, tell the good news story.
Tell him that you see the risks of the road ahead and tell him that you have like mitigation strategies for them. Okay, so, and then, and maybe, maybe I don't need to need to go through and then explain to him why you need finance right now. You know that. 
Tim: Okay. All right. Yeah, yeah. So I can give the overarching thing, talking about all the different really cool things.
Positive first, 
Tom: positive stuff. And challenges. The challenges, yeah. Acknowledgement of that. 
Tim: Difficulty with the industry and everything like that. Um, and then have a going about and mitigation strategy and. And then go into, um, greater threats at the moment. Um, then around like now, cause we push this stuff up and then the economy, like, you know, our cashflow is lumpy as stock.
Tom: Um, we've got a shortfall. Yeah. So that's why you need a scale. So then you don't have as lumpy cash flow if you have like more significant month penetration. I think, I think the better way 
Tim: to go about this is from the agreement that time. It's a necessary thing. I don't need to convince him that we should go for the raise.
That's an obvious thing. I need to convince him that it's a, a safe loan to, to give me that it is four, six months and what that time will give me like that's, that will be of extreme value to the company. It's two months from now after I've gone through like more things with this current opportunity.
Then I'll very likely be at a stage where any of these different things have come off where we've got 
Tom: this revenue. Yeah. And also you may have a significant improvement in your cost per unit manufactured, if you can do this like turnaround time thing with like GPT four that alters those files 
Tim: directly.
Yeah, I probably won't talk too much about that unless us, I'll probably be like now. I'm not gonna go into it too much, but you can see on my work at the moment, um, over the last two weeks, we have potentially had a breakthrough that could completely revolutionize, um, the way this company can scale and what it can do.
Tom: Yeah. But I think, I think it's the key points to that, you know, good news. Acknowledging the risks in the road ahead, explaining why you need that financing now, and 
Tim: then asking him for it, and then going into, um, now I prepared a short presentation to give you a bit more context around the label end at the moment.
Yep. Um, in order to help make your, your decision or something. So how did actually go about the ask? So it'd being like, right. These, these are the sort of reasons why we're in this cash flow thing. And I, I wanna make that easy to understand because that's a very reasonable thing to, to have happened given all of the contexts.
Yeah. Like this is 
Tom: extremely like Yeah. I think that's why it's so important that he sees you as good risk manager. Yeah. And that's why you go say, I acknowledge the risk in the road and the challenges ahead. This is why we need to position ourselves for that by scaling is if we are more diversified, our cash flows less lovely and we ride with the overall market and we can do that efficiently.
Yeah, cut the narrative that I would be most inclined to buy into. Very true. That's a good 
Tim: one. Especially 
Tom: because, Now that you've mentioned that one of his immediate thoughts as an investor 
Tim: will be, well, what's gonna stop you 
Tom: needing another 50 grand and two? Exactly. Yeah. He doesn't wanna get deeper into our hole.
He wants to wait until the storm has happened and then go see what's left. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's the job. We've given an investor. Very true. I head off, mate, coming in. It's been very, very engaging, but I know you'll, I know, I know you'll crush it. Thanks, 
Tim: man. I, uh, You're real shame if I didn't, cuz I have the right story.
Mm-hmm. It's just delivering it 
Tom: properly. Yep. I think you'll, you'll find a way, you know, like even if it leads you to a pathway where you have to lose staff for a period of time. Lose staff. Yeah. If you had to like Well, 
Tim: I've, I, I've told everyone about the position that we're in. Yeah. That was a she conversation.
Yeah. I think I. That was before you and I thought when I was not in a great place. 
Tom: Yeah, it's tough. It's tough, man. Yeah, but you, you've just gotta, I've never had to do that before. That's the main point. You've gotta realize that you are here to keep this company running, number one, and keep everyone else happy and engaged in the work.
Number two. But like if the company goes under, they don't have a job anyway. Yeah, true. Yeah. So I don't feel bad about it. You're just doing, yeah. I. I don't like, I, I 
Tim: spent, I did quite a lot of reflection, um, since all of that cause I was in a bad place. Um, but I've been working on good strategies and since been working, actually, I've got myself back into, you know, a more objective mindset, recognizing all of the really awesome things and that it's.
Really not a, a mark on my ability that we're like right here. 
Tom: It's, you're in the valley of death. That's okay. Yeah, it's okay. It's just part of the business cycle, mate. Like you're in the hardest part. 
Tim: Um, yeah. For almost the funnest part. Fucking hell. I like, I'm so excited. 
Tom: Still ready? I'm so excited for getting that moment.
Got I got. Bye. Good luck with it. I'd be keen to sort of build this with you. Yeah, I'm keen to like, but now like pleasure stand out. Actually, I.

# Tim, Simon and Eric

﻿Tim (ConceptV CEO), Eric (Director of Aura Ventures) and Simon (director of Base Capital) 12 May 2023 (GPT some names have been mis allocated here, separate Tim from the others):












Tim: This is the third time I've been to Sydney. The whole effort of going to an airport and getting on a plane, whether it's an hour flight or a three-hour flight, it's just as annoying.


Eric: In Australia, we don't see the point of doing interstate for a holiday.


Simon: This is the beauty of being miles from everywhere else in the world. What's the flight time to Bali?


Tim: Five to six hours.


Simon: I suppose you guys go to Bali.


Tim: We don't really have destinations like Mar DiUS. 


Simon: That's an international flight scene. I hate you guys. 


Eric: I never really thought of it that way. Like you guys would have the same issue.


Simon: Trying to go anywhere in Australia is a lot of effort. It's really cool here though.


Tim: I know that it's a six and a half hour flight to Bali because I was there and everything was fine until I fell off my moped and hurt my tailbone. Then I got really sick and I couldn't eat or drink anything for two days. The flight back was the worst.


Simon: So, I have mixed feelings about going places.


Tim: And you don't mind having a butler everywhere, like they show in the ads.


Eric: I never really understood purchasing a car until last year when I was traveling. In the US I felt poor, but in Bangkok and Bali, I felt wealthy.


Tim: At some point, both of you need to visit me in Cape Pine.


Simon: But how much do Ubers cost around there? I go to the North Shore for like $20.


Tim: That same trip's going to cost you $6. I caught a $40 Uber this morning for a 15-20 minute drive. I refuse to use Ubers if I'm in the middle of the city heading out.


Eric: It's faster to go directly to the cab rank.


Tim: It's more convenient to pay for an Uber to pick you up and take you home. Public transport is a hassle.


Eric: No chance. But a taxi is fine.


Tim: Seriously? Ubers are more expensive than taxis?


Eric: They price proof it. It's not ingrained in our habits.


Tim: Is that the case in Brisbane as well?


Simon: Could be.


Tim: My tactic is to start with low expectations.


Simon: Just to prove the idiocy point, what did you do? I heard you cut off your own thumb.


Tim: Yes, three years ago. I've been building stuff for ages. I grew up on a farm, so the mentality is to figure it out anyway. I was cutting up flyboard for a trade show and wasn't being safe. The table saw kicked back and my hand went right into the blade. It crushed the bone and ripped it out.


Simon: That sounds terrible.


Tim: They drilled in from the top bit of bone that was still there and then drilled it into my hand.


Eric: Wait, so that's the missing piece and they attached it?


Tim: Yes, the blade crushed that bit of bone and ripped it out. That's the little bit floating on top. There was like one millimeter of skin that was just flapping it off.


Simon: I texted my boss, telling him I couldn't make the trade show because I'd cut my thumb off. He thought I was joking and sent back a rude message.


Tim: I ended up calling a couple of friends. One came over and completed my work, while the other collected the trade show equipment.


Simon: The next day, my girlfriend took me from the hospital to the trade show. I was high on morphine and painkillers, still doing seminars and interviews.


Tim: I found three things difficult: picking up a coin, fidgeting with a small bead, and washing spoons while texting.


Simon: What's the dumbest way you've hurt yourself?


Eric: I once broke my foot trying to kick a soccer ball as high as I could. The ball was over-inflated and felt like a bowling ball.


Tim: It's unfortunate, but that's the job.


Eric: It's not just unfortunate, it's nonsensical. Take a football for example. It's designed for athletes to generate power and aim for a goal.


Simon: Yes, I agree. So you're saying one has to be smart and not just lucky?


Eric: Absolutely. But luck does play a role. Consider lottery for instance. You can't simply work your way to winning it, you need to buy a ticket.


Tim: That's right, buying a ticket is the first step. 


Simon: It's on the way to work.


Eric: Yes, and every time I buy a ticket, I feel like I'm improving my odds. Perhaps buying more increases the chances.


Simon: Let's start with one this week.


Eric: Sounds good. Remember when we saved last week? Maybe we can afford two this time.


Tim: That's a solid strategy. It's a game of probability, after all. The more you buy, the more chances to win. 


Simon: That's true.


Tim: Now, remember the time when the jackpot was a hundred million? We pooled in, and I was the one to buy the tickets. I had a good feeling about it, so much so that I missed my stop on the train. 


Simon: And you ended up losing your wallet.


Eric: Exactly. I was so stressed about losing the winning ticket that I paid $100 to get my wallet back.


Simon: So you were down $150.


Tim: Not to mention the potential hundred million.


Eric: But in the end, we won $1500. 


Simon: That was a brilliant move.


Tim: A great investment indeed.


Eric: It made me want to try my luck more often.


Simon: Let's do this.


Tim: Just remember, we're early-stage investors, not gamblers.


Eric: Of course, but I still enjoy trying my luck.


Simon: Once is enough, you've done well.


Eric: Yes, but it's interesting to note that despite missing all five numbers, we still won because of the power hit.


Simon: We could've been one of the 300 winners.


Eric: Yes, it was a rollercoaster of luck and unluck.


Simon: Yes, it was.


Tim: Now, let's talk about gambling.


Simon: There's so much advertisement around it.


Eric: In Australia, we even have the Melbourne Cup, where everyone gets excited. They even stop education for it.


Simon: When is the Melbourne Cup?


Eric: I think it's the first or second Tuesday of November.


Tim: That's correct. I remember in fourth grade, I had a good feeling about a particular horse. It was my teacher Ms. Bin who got me interested.


Simon: Tim, what's on your Christmas wish list?


Tim: I recall a time when someone was distributing small pieces of paper. One particular piece caught my attention.


Simon: And I won...


Tim: ...five Friday frogs. It was a big deal back then. 


Eric: That's a significant win in the playground economy. It's worth a lot, and it brought me many friends.


Tim: It gained me a lot of social standing.


Simon: It's like gambling.


Tim: Yes, it is.


Eric: I don't think it's as bad as...


Tim: ...the US. I believe you all are slightly smarter than us.


Simon: Thanks. Tim and I originally met at a pitch day. 


Tim: We connected mostly over digital matters, which I assume you and Mike also share.


Simon: At the last minute...


Tim: ...I received a message that the pitch was cancelled. I was disappointed but ended up spending 45 minutes getting advice from Simon.


Simon: Yes, I did help you out.


Tim: Hopefully, I'll give the same advice when you're in town.


Simon: Are you calling one of us an idiot?


Tim: I'm the one who broke my foot, so I'm the idiot. 


Simon: A broken foot is no laughing matter.


Eric: I broke my foot trying to kick something. Afterwards, I started drinking a lot of milk to recover.


Tim: You didn't break your foot kicking a soccer ball correctly, you did it wrong.


Eric: Actually, I broke my foot trying to defy gravity. I was trying to send the ball into space.


Tim: That's a story of a curious person trying to understand the world around them.


Eric: You're like Australia's Elon Musk, but with a broken foot.


Tim: Can you design a car?


Simon: No, but...


Eric: ...I can try to send a ball into space.


Simon: Are you training the next SpaceX engineer?


Tim: Not this time. 


Simon: We'll try again next week. How long are you in Sydney?


Tim: Until Saturday. I have some meetings, but we could meet for coffee.


Simon: That works. Let's meet after 2. Where are you based?


Tim: Two blocks from Monte Place, near Kings Cross. What email service do you use for work?


Simon: We use Office 365, but it's not great.


Tim: I use Zoho. I appreciate their attempt to disrupt the market.


Simon: Have you tried Superhuman?


Eric: It's hard to justify the $30 monthly fee, but it's useful. It has lots of shortcuts and helps me get to inbox zero.


Simon: If it saves you time, it's worth it.


Tim: Absolutely, even if it saves just an hour a day, it's worth the $30. What's a few hundred dollars in the grand scheme of things?


Eric: I agree. 


Simon: I'll give it a go. 


Tim: One day, I'll show you how it works.


Simon: Please do. 


Eric: We should go to a park and film this.


Tim: It's like sending a video to Elon Musk.


Simon: And getting Twitter verified.


Simon: Something amusing happened. This guy, 


Tim: It sometimes looks like a phallic symbol. I'm more concerned about your perception.


Simon: That's hilarious. But remember, all shapes and sizes.


Tim: I was with friends and one took a picture of the sunset. It was shortly after my thumb injury, so I was making jokes. The photo ended up looking like a phallic symbol. My cousin, a nurse, shared the story with her surgeon colleagues. It was an awkward moment.


Simon: What's in the background?


Eric: Who is that guy? 


Simon: That's the next model of the ex. It's so aerodynamic.


Tim: Have you seen Sabar's new gadget? 


Simon: No.


Tim: He rounded the top because of a movie.


Eric: He admitted that it doesn't affect aerodynamics, but he thought it was funny.


Tim: It's fun to be a meme character in real life.


Simon: It's enjoyable to throw Easter eggs if you're skilled at something. That's a legacy.


Tim: When I'm 70, I want to look back and enjoy how much I trolled everyone.


Simon: There's a story about my cousin, a photographer.


Tim: He wanted to do a Steve Jobs-type shot. The photo turned out to be humorous. I decided to use it for staff gifts, printing it on mugs.


Simon: You got targeted by an ad for that?


Tim: Yes, and it seemed like a good idea at the time. 


Simon: You printed a lot of those mugs.


Tim: Yes, I did. I forgot about them until my girlfriend found the delivery. I started leaving the mugs at friends' houses. It was rewarding when they found them later.


Simon: Why do you have this picture of me? Are you planning to print them?


Tim: I got new headshots done recently. I'm thinking of printing them as stickers and hiding them in seldom-used places. I also found heat-based mugs that show an image when hot. We've even made a 3D model to hide in the products we deliver.


Simon: Has anyone ever noticed?


Tim: No, but we are planning to run a campaign in two years where if you can spot all the hidden images, you'll win a prize.


Eric: So you're doing 3D renders?


Tim: Yes, we're focusing on architecture and privacy. I could place the 3D model in one of the neighboring properties. We've also recently discovered how to incorporate moving images into the online versions, so I'm thinking of including a hidden video too.


Simon: You're having a lot of fun with this.


Tim: Yes, it's important to enjoy the process. When I started, I knew it would be a long journey and now we're at a point where we can have fun with our work.


Eric: It's crucial to have fun where you can.


Tim: Definitely. I see it as a slingshot strategy. You grind until you reach a certain point, and then you can just have fun. We reached that point about three months ago.


Simon: So, how do you think your professional pitch is going?


Tim: I hope I come across as succinct and to the point.


Eric: You're doing a great job of tying in different concepts and simplifying language.


Tim: We're on the same page; you want to invest in Alex's venture.


Simon: And you're willing to risk your money on it.


Eric: You both are exactly the partners I've been seeking. It'll be a fun journey with potential challenges. 


Simon: I've already sacrificed a lot for this, so I'm in.


Tim: We need to start first thing tomorrow morning. 


Simon: After a long day of travel, I just arrived in Sydney. 


Tim: My partner is worried that I might move here soon. 


Simon: I'm open to the idea of moving. 


Eric: Australia has the best food. It's about the quality of the ingredients.


Simon: So you're talking about ingredient quality rather than the cuisine?


Eric: Exactly. It's the best on average. You'll find good food in Europe, but it lacks variety.


Simon: So you're saying the US has poor quality food?


Eric: Yes, even their steaks aren't good.


Tim: I've traveled a bit, and I can confirm, the food and coffee in the US aren't good.


Simon: That explains the prevalence of Starbucks there.


Tim: And that's why Starbucks couldn't establish itself in Australia.


Eric: Starbucks didn't make it here because it wasn't good enough.


Simon: They expanded quickly in the US, then opened a bunch of stores in Brisbane.


Tim: But they had to close most of them within two years.


Simon: There are only a few left now.


Tim: It was a failed business case.


Simon: But they do like their IPAs in the US.


Tim: Yes, especially in San Francisco.


Simon: A lot of IPAs there.


Eric: Speaking of drinks, when I sent the invite for this meet-up, I named it Castle Lago. I had to look up South African beers to find a name.


Tim: We manufacture about 20% of the world's beer.


Simon: That's astonishing.


Eric: At my local pub, I can get two beers for five dollars.


Simon: That's quite a deal.


Tim: But this city is expensive, especially property and dining.


Simon: You'd typically pay around 30 to 40 dollars for a meal here.


Eric: You could pay that for two people elsewhere.


Tim: But the higher salaries here offset the cost of living.


Simon: Have I told you about the power situation here?


Eric: My apartment's electricity will be out intermittently tomorrow: between midnight and 2:30 AM, 6 and 10:30 AM, and 4 and 6:30 PM.


Tim: Someone must have developed an app due to frustrations with similar issues.


Eric: This issue has been persistent for years.


Simon: It paints a confusing picture. On one hand, I want to go, but on the other, I'm not so sure.


Tim: My younger brother lives in the UK. Every time he visits Cape, he's reminded of its paradise-like qualities despite power issues.


Simon: You guys would have an incredible time there.


Tim: I don't know much about travel, based on my experience with Bali.


Simon: Just remember to bring your donuts.


Eric: There's no better place than Australia in the summer, be it Sydney or Brisbane.


Simon: I prefer cooler weather, but most people love Brisbane's summer.


Eric: Sydney's weather is perfect, Melbourne is hot enough on most days.


Tim: Some days it's so hot, you step out and immediately want to retreat to the air conditioning.


Simon: How did you guys meet?


Eric: It's easier to invest as an investor.


Tim: I could just text you to meet up, it's not weird.


Simon: It's common among venture teams.


Eric: We lost one to South Africa.


Tim: We gained one guy.


Simon: Excuse me for 10 minutes.


Eric: Brisbane and Sydney will eventually merge into one city, but it's a 100-year plan.


Simon: Infrastructure growth is slow.


Tim: In the late sixties, a traffic advisor from San Francisco suggested cutting off public transport and building highways.


Simon: A typical Californian approach.


Tim: It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now it's problematic. Brisbane built one freeway, cut off some train stations, and discontinued the tram. Now they're facing challenges.


Simon: At least we have electricity.


Eric: I can hardly imagine power outages.
Simon: They're disruptive.
Eric: Even a fire alarm test annoys me, but an outage is a whole other level.
Tim: It's more complicated than it needs to be.
Simon: It happens monthly.
Tim: Is that due to your building's age?
Eric: Over the top safety regulations are part of it, especially in Sydney. I prefer Melbourne's more laid-back approach.
Simon: Sydney tends to be overprotective.
Eric: If people can't learn from their mistakes, let natural selection take its course.
Tim: I've learned from my mistakes and improved.
Simon: And you've survived.
Tim: I think of this as an upgrade.
Simon: It's like we're trying to balance the American and British systems of law, finding a middle ground between total freedom and strict regulation.
Tim: Despite some odd rules, we've done well overall.
Simon: Except for the ban on soccer balls in the city.
Tim: Those rules are too strict.
Eric: Singapore's system is impressive.
Simon: Interesting.
Tim: These rules, though recent, have affected Singapore's tourism.
Simon: Most of their tourism is business-related anyway.
Eric: They've managed issues like legalized prostitution pragmatically to control potential harm.
Simon: They've established principle-based rules.
Eric: They enforce rules strictly, especially new ones. They rule by fear.
Simon: You were lucky when you violated the littering rule.
Eric: I didn't see a single police officer during my month-long stay there.
Tim: There might be strong community enforcement.
Simon: They seem to tolerate tourists' mistakes more.
Tim: It's a matter of balance.
Simon: You've got an outgoing personality, Eric.
Eric: I don't enjoy it.
Simon: It can be uncomfortable.
Tim: It's challenging to be thrust into social situations.




Eric: I respect those who can build their own brand and overcome imposter syndrome. However, I hesitate to publicly make bold statements if I feel I haven't earned the right to do so.


Tim: People tend to accept what's been promoted through an authority as gospel, a phenomenon visible during Trump's presidency.


Simon: It's problematic when someone asks you a question, expecting you to have all the answers.


Eric: When it comes to first-time site managers or other partners, I prefer to stay quiet unless I've worked with them long enough to understand their situation and offer valuable advice. Giving general observations and recommendations can be more harmful than beneficial.


Tim: As a founder, people are always seeking advice. They often preface their statements with disclaimers, highlighting that it's just their opinion. But the moment their words are put on a reported platform or online, everything gets misconstrued.


Simon: It creates a divide where some people are comfortable speaking on camera, while others, who perhaps should be speaking, opt to stay silent.


Tim: I'd argue for you to keep sharing your personal account, including your background and experiences, while also acknowledging that you're not always right. General feedback can be helpful, and if the audience knows your area of expertise, they can use your advice accordingly.


Simon: That makes sense.


Eric: We'll catch up tomorrow, right?


Tim: Yeah, I initially thought our meeting place was four hours away, but it's actually just 10 minutes from where I am. We could meet for a late lunch around 1:30?


Simon: Sounds good.


Tim: If you want to know more about what we do, you can scan this QR code.


Eric: Is this the email I should send?


Tim: Yes, this is for people I meet in person.


Simon: It's a neat concept.


Tim: I'm considering potential name rebrands, by the way. I've also been working on a crude business AI that can help with organization and documentation. Any suggestions are welcome.


Tim: I've set up a voice recording function to discuss business elements, tasks, and assignments. At the end of every day, it processes the information into categories for my team to see.


Simon: Always closely observe people like Boston Current. I'll text you in two years.


Tim: I once walked away with a giant blotch on my butt.


Simon: That's unique. I should stop talking, really.


Simon: He's a great guy, very ambitious, a bit like me. I think he's got a bit of an ego.


Tim: We got a New Zealand-based business, Univers flag, in the architectural space. Have you guys discussed it?


Simon: It's an interesting space. Architects are unique.


Tim: Given my track history, even if I know the right way, I'll still get lost. Should I go to Wynyard Station or Town Hall station, or should I catch an Uber?


Simon: I'm tempted by the latter, but I'd suggest catching the train. It's not a rush.


Tim: Okay, I'll catch the train then.


Simon: So, go straight down here to Tunnel Station, platform 5. That's a number you should remember.

220816 ConceptV letter of support  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tim called me in May this year asking for my feedback on a new product he was bringing to 
market , and we’ve been keeping in touch since then. Recently, we were asked to provide a service 
proposal for a large development with very new design principles.  
We have recently submitted our services proposal for the design and implementation of a large 
comm unity centric peri -urban residential development and would like to engage the ConceptV 
team as part of this work. The first stage consists of 100 homes, scaling up to 2,000. We have 
placed a proposal with the developer in Victoria and are awaiting a respon se. 
The developers want to implement innovative design principles, steering away from the typical 
compact stock aimed at a particular demographic in favour of a community oriented, inclusive 
architecture with a strong focus on adaptable living and sustaina bility. To do so, they want 
exposure and create a large following.  
As part of the service proposal, we want to be able to communicate with the wider community to 
get feedback on design principles, and allow suggestions and feedback. We want to be able to 
funnel the audience in three tiers:  
1. Public - everyone in order to collect mass data on peoples preferences  
2. Interested parties - people that are genuinely interested in the concept and considering 
being a part of it  
3. Committed parties - people who have paid a  deposit and intend on living in the 
community once it’s completed  
Each of these stages will contribute differently, becoming more granular the further down the list. 
We want people to be able to actively contribute to the architecture of their community.   
We discussed our vision for the project, and Tim told me more about how his product works and 
what it can do. The opportunity exists not only for an innovative approach to a new way of living, 
but also in pathways to market and user oriented engagement an d empowerment to influence 
their own living environment.  
With ConceptV’s innovation, our service proposal enables:  
 A widely, immediately accessible model of the project through every medium of public 
contact  
 A simple, intuitive, comprehensive and engaging method showcasing key design principles 
to every demographic

 An easy way to collect feedback and preferences on innovative design principles from the 
masses  
 Demographic specific preferences   
 Warm leads and sales funnels  
 Removal of risk of misconception abo ut the design  
 The community to be actively involved in where they’re going to live  
 Market testing and value perception of new principles to de -risk the development  
With their technology, we  would  be able to curate economically viable design principles for 
suburban living through wide facing communication and feedback from the public.  The innovation 
that ConceptV are bringing to the market enables communication on a whole new scale. The 
capacity and potential of their platform is unique, and has the potential to bring enormous value to 
everyone involved in the design and construct of property.  
We would very much look forward to working with ConceptV on this project and others into the 
future .

W A L A   –   W E I A N   L I M   A R C H I T E C T S 
 
18 August 2022  
 
 
 
Re: Letter of Recommendation for Concept V  
 
 
 
To whom it may concern,  
 
 
Tim Geldard of ConceptV reached out to our team in late May this year  and, after discussing 
the possible applications for their virtual tour platform, decided to see how the platform could 
be integrated with our process with a free proof of concept.  (Reference tour: 
https://con ceptv.io/panotours/client/wala/thecrescent ) 
 
In our experience , our clients find it challenging  to understand their  building  design from 
technical drawings , especially if they have no prior construction knowledge or experience . This 
leads to our studio relying heavily on  visual aids to help communicate the design which results 
in inefficiencies and a longer time spent of projects .   
 
Recent years have seen a somewhat open -minded adoption of virtual reality among design 
studios in the AEC industry . VR was touted as the next big thing in the toolkit for architects 
building designers and developers. However,  we have obser ved that the use of VR is not a 
‘one-size-fits-all’ solution and hence VR adoption in the industry has been met with varied 
success. Based on feedback from clients and industry peers, the use of VR can be limited 
both as a physical design tool and as somet hing consumers  may be uncomfortable with (i.e. 
experiences of vertigo and/or dizziness when wearing a VR headset). In addition to VR, t here 
are other companies experimenting with innovations to help c onsumers  bridge the divide 
between pap er-architecture and final -build, such as ones  project ing 1:1 scale floorplans  that 
allow people  to do a quasi -real life walkthrough of the proposed architecture . But they too face 
limitations  – these methods do not successfully  capture  a true  sense of scale, light or colours.  
 
Both of the se tools/offerings are only able to leave an imp ression on our clients within a limited 
amount of time (1 -2hrs) due to the physical setup  of proprietary equipment in a fixed 
office/warehouse space. O ftentimes it’s hard for people to make the time during a work week  
to participate  and even if they do, they are only afforded  a small window of time to digest the 
visual information and subsequent decide , from memory,  what they want to do.   
 
Even if our practice  incorporates  VR into our design process , the barriers to adoption can be 
quite prohibitive for a small business  such as ours . The hardware can be expensive which 
means we’d have to change our process and spend more time on each project . Bigger studios 
can afford the extra cost, so we lose some jobs because bigger studios have more perceive d 
value.   
 
When we trialled ConceptV’s platform, it took far less effort than I expected. The whole process 
of getting it made took me less than 10 minutes  and they managed to create everything from 
files we alr eady had. I liked that we did not  need to go and get new hardware or go through a 
whole process of installing something new and learning how to use it. When we got it back, it 
just worked.

The platform Conce ptV developed is very intuitive; even our less tech -savvy client s will  be 
able to easily engage with the 3D model on their own personal devices very quickly.  The 3D 
model can be delivered  to our clients over Zoom, and with a QR code for them to scan  via 
their mobile phone s, they can have in in the palm of their hand ( literally ) straight away. Our 
clients need not take  time off work to understand their design  – they are able to access an 
easy -to-use interface at their own time and jump straight into the 3D model  with immediacy . 
They can go through it as often  as they want, think it through with friends and  family and 
ultimately make  more informed, concise decisions. I can see it being a significant help to many 
of my clients  as well as a helpful tool for our design team . 
 
ConceptV hav e built a lo t more into it than I’d thought and  it’s very versatile. 90% of our 
business c omes through word -of-mouth, and because our clients have it readily available on 
their phone, they’ll show it to their friends and family and our brand is right on top. We can 
host it on our website, so we can show prospective buyers the kind of experience  they could 
get with us and increase our perceived value to compete against the larger studios.  
 
Whilst w e haven’t had the chance to test it yet  with a live project,  I can see a big benefit for 
construction. There are man y sets of documentation on site  and it’s not uncommon that 
different people will have different revisions. It can be a struggle for contractors to keep on top 
of all the variations to  the technical drawings, so it’s up to the site supervisor to educate 
everyone and make sure everything goes  the way it’s supposed to. Having a central, accurate 
model that everyone can access and understand will go a long way to reducing mistakes, and 
likely save the clients quite a lot of money.  
 
I’m a big supporter of the platform. Compared with other availab le offerings, I believe this has 
the potential for mass -adoption across the industry due to its low barrier o f adoption, ease of 
use, and reasonable pricing which caters very well to smaller design studios looking at  
providing consumers with an excellent t ool/service that does not discriminate . I’m excited to 
offer this to my clients and see how it evolves.   
 
All things considered, the WALA team believes that ConceptV is offering a very interesting 
and useful solution to the architect ure industry.
